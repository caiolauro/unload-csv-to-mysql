We highly recommend that you purchase travel insurance. Problems can arise in multiple ways and travel insurance can be a low cost guard against losing your money if you have last minute problems and have to cancel. In the past, some of our guests have obtained insurance by going to various insurance sites for details and to purchase. We did call the people at InsureMyTrip and they do have plans that will cover for Covid issues but there are several important steps and needs to be done shortly after making your first deposit. The plans are called ""Cancel For Any Reason"" CFAR. Check with your insurance agent before deciding what insurance to purchase. We DO NOT endorse any insurance in particular.

Filled with glimpses of the past, guests enjoy charming antique-filled rooms, Wi-Fi, kitchen, new bath, queen bed, fireplace.  Near the New River Gorge National Park, Pipestem zipline, ATV trails, hiking, kayaking, caves/caverns & more. Watch deer graze in the pastures as you sit back and enjoy peace in the valley. Located just off I-77, exit 14. A step back in time ...

Guests will enjoy the whole house. Historic home is smoke free, pet free, and vape free. Each room is appointed with beautiful antique quilts, old trunks, and pieces of furniture used on the farm. It is like a museum! Of course, there has been added the modern recliner for sitting and sipping coffee while watching the deer eat apples from the old tree!

The main floor has a sunporch with a spectacular view of the valley. Guests can enjoy views of sunrise and sunset in both rain and shine! The main floor also has a kitchen, dining area, living room with fireplace, and sitting room. Beautiful tiled bathroom with shower is on main floor.  Choose to sleep on main floor or in loft. The loft has a queen size bed, sitting area, and closet. All rooms have antiques and beautiful furnishings.

If you are looking for pampered, modern conveniences this is not your place. If you want peace, quiet, tranquility amid old relics, antiques, and farm pastures you will enjoy this property. The homestead is much like it was during the time it was built (early 1900s). It is intended to give visitors and guests an idea of how living on the farm in the early years might have been. Not for the allergy sensitive as it is a farm with hayfields, etc.

Please note: This is an old cabin on a septic system in the countryside.  For safety reasons, we strictly enforce the use of it to 2 people ONLY. We do not share/offer property as a meeting or gathering place.

During the day, guests may enjoy a walk to the barn in the lower pastures (following the designated path only). There you can access the river and fish (bring your own fishing pole and/or kayak) or have fun just splashing around! This area is restricted to day use only and no ATVs or dirt bikes are allowed on the property. No sport shooting on property.

You may text me with questions at any time.

This property is located in the countryside surrounded by mountains and valleys. There are 2 churches (Methodist and Baptist), a post office, a school (K-5), and a small convenience store w gas/groceries is 3 miles away. This property is near Camp Creek State Forest, Pipestem, Bluestone State Parks, Pinnacle Rock State Park, outdoor rafting, ATV riding on the Hatfields and McCoys Trail, America's newest National park: The New River Gorge National Park, and much more! It takes approximately 5 minutes to reach Interstate 77 from the cabin, exit 14.

You will need transportation to get to everything to see and do. There is no public transit system in the countryside. :)

Designed for couples,This historic filling station was acquired,gutted and purposely rebuilt for you,the discerning traveler,the parents of the students, or the traveling Doctor or Nurse. Designed in an urban industrial style, he unit is completely smart enabled,handicap accessible and overflowing with amenities that you would only expect from the most well known 5 star resorts. 15% Military Discount.

Welcome to the Carbon Flat. This is a multi-faceted passion project that not only offers housing for the parents of the University students, but is also in an effort to invest in the local community  and help grow much needed infrastructure.  This building was acquired, redesigned, gutted, stripped, and purposely rebuilt FOR you. I applied myself, thoroughly researched the concept of airbnb, developed a plan, and am now implementing that plan for ""TOP OF THE LINE EXPERIENCE AND SERVICE"",  In which I have provided for more than a decade.  I built and operated an Ultra exclusive boutique beach resort In Southeast Asia. As well as a beach lounge and restaurant that was considered ""the living room"" of Khao-Lak Beach, Thailand. I have lived and traveled abroad extensively, which I do believe lends to One's ability to recognize, appreciate,  and implement, this level of service. 

From the exterior. I chose to design the building in a very trendy ""urban industrial"" monochromatic color scheme which uses a lot of one color in different hues. For this project I chose, carbonized grey. Hence the name, The Carbon Flat. I accentuated this dark and sort of  'blah' color with western red cedar, that I stained Mahogany Flame. It is quite dramatic, yet calming. I highlighted certain areas in stone, and others with foliage from local plants.  We installed a wheelchair accessible, concrete ramp, at a 3 degree gradient, to not only allow for a wheelchair, but also make it easier for luggage and minimize someone tripping. 

 On to the inside....

Posh, yet practical. Again, I put thought into every decision, researching what had the best reviews for comfort and functionality, while also balancing  function with form and design. I wanted to bring a little of the out side in, so I used a much more subtle grey, almost blue Pallet. I Then painted the  oak cabinets with the carbonized grey from outside. Additionally I used  western red cedar with the same  Is mahogany flame stain for crown molding. For a focal point, I had a custom mural done on the largest  wall. Its very thought provoking and perfect for the space which by the numbers seems small but with 12 foot high ceilings, makes it feel so much bigger.  I built and installed custom Acacia wood butcher block counter tops, with a Kraus workstation sink That I believe was intended to give a  farmhouse look, but it only lends to this funky design. It has a  built in chopping block and dish drainer. 

The kitchen was stocked with everything that a chef would appreciate. From  beautiful Damascus steel knives, to an Air fryer range that's front controlled and ADA compliant. Coffee and tea lovers? There is a Nespresso Machine that makes the absolute best coffee, stocked with Nespresso's best  coffee offerings as well as from Starbucks and other favorites. . There is a French Press, Bodum Pour over, Krups Noiseless grinder, and several different options for coffee in  fresh bean form in case you wanted to make your travelling companion their first pour over. Double walled glass  cappuccino and espresso mugs, and milk frother.  Individually wrapped tea bags from Twinning's, Taylors of Harrogate, Harford and Sons, and individually wrapped loose leaf tea from all over the world. There is an authentic cast iron Tetsubin  Japanese Tea set that, by the artist, was named after Rikyu (Rentarô Mikuni), a Buddhist priest who believes in the spiritual healing inherent in the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. There’s a Fellow Stagg EKG Digital kettle that’s ranked #1 by baristas and has a beautiful design. The best pour, for your pour-over. And only the best for you. 

Appreciate nice bath towels, or quality sleep? I chose to use  UGG Pacha line Turkish Cotton (and oversized) for all of the bath towels, hand towels, and wash cloths. I  Used UGG for most of the comforters and throws, and there will be several options for the guests when it comes to pillows and sheets, in case you don’t like the crazy high thread count Egyptian cotton ones that will be on the 14 inch hybrid, and fully adjustable bed. Makes it nice if you want to set the head up so you can watch the 75  inch tv,  with amazon prime, local cable, and top it off , a service that gives you every single cable channel from around the world, in different languages, including every single  pay per view event. It also has every single movie that comes out in theaters sometimes while they are still in the theaters. This is a legal service so there are no movies recorded with cellphones. I enjoy high quality Audio but had never bought anything from Klipsch. I wont ever buy anything else again.  You have a Klipsch Three 11 in the flat.   Bose, Sonos, eat your heart out. To sweeten the audio experience, is a fully automatic Audio Technica record player and a nice selection of records from every genre. Just let me know what tickles your fancy and it will be playing for you when you walk through the door. For you business travelers, there is  a wireless printer for your use. 

The lounging furniture are top grain leather , fully reclinable, with adjustable head and footrest, and lumbar also  with built in wireless charging for your phones. I have provided a few reading options including newer books, and a few dating all the way back to the 1850’s. Its really neat to look through them and compare societal differences of then and now and the amazing art done on old school press plates. There are few tastefully chosen board games. A bookcase edition scrabble, and a Luxury Edition Monopoly.  I built  a little area with accompaniments for adult beverages, and a nice Westin orange  juicer, which will always be accompanied by  fresh fruit, in case you would like to get up in the morning and juice some oranges for your “better half”. 

For you adult beverage drinkers there is a nice selection of glass ware. Vintage Paulaner Hefeweizen Glasses, which there are several already in the freezer for you. Huge Bordeaux glasses, glasses for white, lowballs, highballs and if you do partake please let me know in comments when you book that you are ""RED"" or ""WHITE"" and there will be such a thing in the gift basket for you.  

Custom built dining table made from Baltic Beechwood and then a triple coat of epoxy. I built this on an electric, noiseless air frame. You can raise and lower this table from 25 inches all the way up to 48 inches . Feel like standing,  great, sitting, even better. Disabled, I built this for you.  I think I blew ADA Compliant Standards out of the water on This  one. 

Last, but not least. The Bathroom. Continuing the décor, I installed  beautiful stone tile flooring, did the walls in a mute industrial concrete waterproof wallpaper. There is a really cool internally lit vanity mirror with a defogger that does not allow it to  get steamed up. My vision to work with local artists and craftsmen to showcase their work was fulfilled in the floating vanity and sink.  99timbers custom designed and built a live edge undermount and backsplash. It matches the beautiful foil-work sink . This sink is wheelchair accessible. There is a walk-in (or roll-in) modern steam shower. I chose grey stack stone and stunning turquoise subway tile, accentuated again by (a water suitable) choice of wood. Teak Floors and Teak Bench. This shower is 60 inches wide and 36 inches deep. It is wheelchair accessible. There is a 10 inch Kohler rain deluge, 8 body jets and an hand wand. Pressure? got pressure for days!!  Hot water you ask, well , I'm sure someone is going to test out that auto defog mirror. Its definitely a steam shower.  There are Turkish Cotton robes behind the bathroom door in multiple sizes for men and women. There is 3 different levels of toiletries based on the length of your stay. Our standard is  L'occitane Mer & Mistral,  If you're staying 3 nights or more you will receive Aprey Purple Water  (Exclusively used by the Ritz Carlton) if you choose to stay 5 nights or more you will receive  Hermès  eau d' orange vert.  Regardless of which level, you will receive shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and body lotion.  There will also be an individually wrapped bar soap from Marseilles.

The unit is completly ""smart"" enabled. You can control everything with your voice. Lights, thermostat, doorlock, T.V.,  Alarm System, Vacuum cleanet. You can ask to see the doorbell camera and your vehicle on the 8 in screen in the Kitchen.  There is also another 5 inch screen. Both of these have manual camera shutters, and by protocol are never opened by me. If you choose to use them for video calling, you are doing so on your own accord. The only thing in the flat that is not smart controlled are the 2 chandeliers. There is too much wattage going through them. There is Also a hidden safe for your valuables. 

I hope you are ok with smart technology. There  is a virtual concierge that will greet you by name as you come in the front door and ask if you are formally checking in.  You will be given a menu of options, or you can ask exactly what you want. I have spent a great deal of time, programming information Such as info about the property , info on anything inside the flat and how to use it, restaurants, things to do, places to see, family friendly activities, hiking, shopping, etc...I have worked with many local restaurants and stores securing exclusive discount coupons for you, but you have to use the virtual concierge.  I have attached many pictures and videos,  of things in the flat that explain things better. So if you don't know how to make a pour over, it will teach you. 

I'm not going to list every little detail. I can only GUARANTEE you will not find anything like it locally, or for this price.  IF you do ill honor my guarantee and give you a weekend for free.

 I am also trying to set the bar for a different kind of service and go above and beyond. If you choose to book and will be staying at the flat long enough to need groceries, You can place a click list order and I will happily pick them up and have them stocked at the flat for you.  Local grocery store options are Kroger, Walmart, and Food Lion.

My father, myself, and generations in my family served in The United States Military. I am proud, and grateful  in offering a 15% military discount for Active Duty or former service members.  Please let me know before booking so that I can send you  the special offer. I would also ask that you provide some sort of verification.,  ie,  base card, VA ID, or DD214. You would want to think that no one would lie about serving in the military for a discount, but we all know better. This is actually a Federal crime punishable under The Stolen Valor Act of 2013 (revised from 2005).

Outside of the flat there are 2 parking spaces solely dedicated  for your use. You then have the sidewalk that winds all the way through the University. It is maintained by the University. For Security, there is the WVU Tech Campus Police and the Beckley Police Department. I have worked closely with both, not only offering to provide a live link to my camera systems, but also taking several other measures to ensure the safety and security of the students, community members, and you!

I will be available at a whim, if anything were needed, for any reason.

Located within the WVU Tech University District, You can walk to any area of the University within 5 minutes.  WVU Tech has also allocated and broken ground on a new dormitory literally across the road from the flat . In literally 10 seconds from the front door you can walk to Jimmy's Place, a local bar, that had been open since the 1960's, but shut down because of Covid 19. Fortunately, a local business owner has opened it back up and is serving food.  The carbon flat is located in the University district but the property behind the flat Is completely wooded..an urban landscape. There are two windows with views of this.

IF you are driving by car , there are two parking spaces in front of the airbnb dedicated solely for your use. Other than that the usual options are available, taxi, uber, public transportation. If you are in need of any information, please let me know and iIwill provide you everything.

#The Carbon Flat goes above and beyond some standards that even 5 star resorts don't implement. 
Firstly we care very much about the air that you breath. We implement a system that you can access, by Bluetooth, our air filtration system, and view the statistics and real time data such as when the filter was changed, and the air quality you are breathing. 

#We also take cleaning extremely serious, and have written protocols (S.O.P's) as to using a ozone generator each time a guest departs. We do this  before we even go in to clean. This prevents us from coming into contact with anything while changing the bed, vacuuming, etc. The ozone machine completely, (even cracks and crevices) kills all bacteria, viruses, mold, and any un thinkables. 

#IF you are handicapped and travelling alone, or travelling with someone but still have some restrictions,  I offer my services to help if I am able, in any way, as I had said before, my father was Quadriplegic for 33 years. I helped with EVERYTHING.  I am cpr certified, and combat medical trained from my time in the military. I offer this at no charge. You can contact me personally, if you would like to inquire about this.","No unregistered guests

#IF you are handicapped and travelling alone, or travelling with someone but still have some restrictions,  I offer my services to help if I am able, in any way, as I had said before, my father was Quadriplegic for 33 years. I helped with EVERYTHING.  I am cpr certified, and combat medical trained from my time in the military. I offer this at no charge. You can contact me personally, if you would like to inquire about this.","Welcome to the Carbon Flat. This is a multi-faceted passion project that not only offers housing for the parents of the University students, but is also in an effort to invest in the local community  and help grow much needed infrastructure.  This building was acquired, redesigned, gutted, stripped, and purposely rebuilt FOR you. I applied myself, thoroughly researched the concept of airbnb, developed a plan, and am now implementing that plan for ""TOP OF THE LINE EXPERIENCE AND SERVICE"",  In which I have provided for more than a decade.  I built and operated an Ultra exclusive boutique beach resort In Southeast Asia. As well as a beach lounge and restaurant that was considered ""the living room"" of Khao-Lak Beach, Thailand. I have lived and traveled abroad extensively, which I do believe lends to One's ability to recognize, appreciate,  and implement, this level of service. 

From the exterior. I chose to design the building in a very trendy ""urban industrial"" monochromatic color scheme which uses a lot of one color in different hues. For this project I chose, carbonized grey. Hence the name, The Carbon Flat. I accentuated this dark and sort of  'blah' color with western red cedar, that I stained Mahogany Flame. It is quite dramatic, yet calming. I highlighted certain areas in stone, and others with foliage from local plants.  We installed a wheelchair accessible, concrete ramp, at a 3 degree gradient, to not only allow for a wheelchair, but also make it easier for luggage and minimize someone tripping. 

 On to the inside....

Posh, yet practical. Again, I put thought into every decision, researching what had the best reviews for comfort and functionality, while also balancing  function with form and design. I wanted to bring a little of the out side in, so I used a much more subtle grey, almost blue Pallet. I Then painted the  oak cabinets with the carbonized grey from outside. Additionally I used  western red cedar with the same  Is mahogany flame stain for crown molding. For a focal point, I had a custom mural done on the largest  wall. Its very thought provoking and perfect for the space which by the numbers seems small but with 12 foot high ceilings, makes it feel so much bigger.  I built and installed custom Acacia wood butcher block counter tops, with a Kraus workstation sink That I believe was intended to give a  farmhouse look, but it only lends to this funky design. It has a  built in chopping block and dish drainer. 

The kitchen was stocked with everything that a chef would appreciate. From  beautiful Damascus steel knives, to an Air fryer range that's front controlled and ADA compliant. Coffee and tea lovers? There is a Nespresso Machine that makes the absolute best coffee, stocked with Nespresso's best  coffee offerings as well as from Starbucks and other favorites. . There is a French Press, Bodum Pour over, Krups Noiseless grinder, and several different options for coffee in  fresh bean form in case you wanted to make your travelling companion their first pour over. Double walled glass  cappuccino and espresso mugs, and milk frother.  Individually wrapped tea bags from Twinning's, Taylors of Harrogate, Harford and Sons, and individually wrapped loose leaf tea from all over the world. There is an authentic cast iron Tetsubin  Japanese Tea set that, by the artist, was named after Rikyu (Rentarô Mikuni), a Buddhist priest who believes in the spiritual healing inherent in the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. There’s a Fellow Stagg EKG Digital kettle that’s ranked #1 by baristas and has a beautiful design. The best pour, for your pour-over. And only the best for you. 

Appreciate nice bath towels, or quality sleep? I chose to use  UGG Pacha line Turkish Cotton (and oversized) for all of the bath towels, hand towels, and wash cloths. I  Used UGG for most of the comforters and throws, and there will be several options for the guests when it comes to pillows and sheets, in case you don’t like the crazy high thread count Egyptian cotton ones that will be on the 14 inch hybrid, and fully adjustable bed. Makes it nice if you want to set the head up so you can watch the 75  inch tv,  with amazon prime, local cable, and top it off , a service that gives you every single cable channel from around the world, in different languages, including every single  pay per view event. It also has every single movie that comes out in theaters sometimes while they are still in the theaters. This is a legal service so there are no movies recorded with cellphones. I enjoy high quality Audio but had never bought anything from Klipsch. I wont ever buy anything else again.  You have a Klipsch Three 11 in the flat.   Bose, Sonos, eat your heart out. To sweeten the audio experience, is a fully automatic Audio Technica record player and a nice selection of records from every genre. Just let me know what tickles your fancy and it will be playing for you when you walk through the door. For you business travelers, there is  a wireless printer for your use. 

The lounging furniture are top grain leather , fully reclinable, with adjustable head and footrest, and lumbar also  with built in wireless charging for your phones. I have provided a few reading options including newer books, and a few dating all the way back to the 1850’s. Its really neat to look through them and compare societal differences of then and now and the amazing art done on old school press plates. There are few tastefully chosen board games. A bookcase edition scrabble, and a Luxury Edition Monopoly.  I built  a little area with accompaniments for adult beverages, and a nice Westin orange  juicer, which will always be accompanied by  fresh fruit, in case you would like to get up in the morning and juice some oranges for your “better half”. 

For you adult beverage drinkers there is a nice selection of glass ware. Vintage Paulaner Hefeweizen Glasses, which there are several already in the freezer for you. Huge Bordeaux glasses, glasses for white, lowballs, highballs and if you do partake please let me know in comments when you book that you are ""RED"" or ""WHITE"" and there will be such a thing in the gift basket for you.  

Custom built dining table made from Baltic Beechwood and then a triple coat of epoxy. I built this on an electric, noiseless air frame. You can raise and lower this table from 25 inches all the way up to 48 inches . Feel like standing,  great, sitting, even better. Disabled, I built this for you.  I think I blew ADA Compliant Standards out of the water on This  one. 

Last, but not least. The Bathroom. Continuing the décor, I installed  beautiful stone tile flooring, did the walls in a mute industrial concrete waterproof wallpaper. There is a really cool internally lit vanity mirror with a defogger that does not allow it to  get steamed up. My vision to work with local artists and craftsmen to showcase their work was fulfilled in the floating vanity and sink.  99timbers custom designed and built a live edge undermount and backsplash. It matches the beautiful foil-work sink . This sink is wheelchair accessible. There is a walk-in (or roll-in) modern steam shower. I chose grey stack stone and stunning turquoise subway tile, accentuated again by (a water suitable) choice of wood. Teak Floors and Teak Bench. This shower is 60 inches wide and 36 inches deep. It is wheelchair accessible. There is a 10 inch Kohler rain deluge, 8 body jets and an hand wand. Pressure? got pressure for days!!  Hot water you ask, well , I'm sure someone is going to test out that auto defog mirror. Its definitely a steam shower.  There are Turkish Cotton robes behind the bathroom door in multiple sizes for men and women. There is 3 different levels of toiletries based on the length of your stay. Our standard is  L'occitane Mer & Mistral,  If you're staying 3 nights or more you will receive Aprey Purple Water  (Exclusively used by the Ritz Carlton) if you choose to stay 5 nights or more you will receive  Hermès  eau d' orange vert.  Regardless of which level, you will receive shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and body lotion.  There will also be an individually wrapped bar soap from Marseilles.

The unit is completly ""smart"" enabled. You can control everything with your voice. Lights, thermostat, doorlock, T.V.,  Alarm System, Vacuum cleanet. You can ask to see the doorbell camera and your vehicle on the 8 in screen in the Kitchen.  There is also another 5 inch screen. Both of these have manual camera shutters, and by protocol are never opened by me. If you choose to use them for video calling, you are doing so on your own accord. The only thing in the flat that is not smart controlled are the 2 chandeliers. There is too much wattage going through them. There is Also a hidden safe for your valuables. 

I hope you are ok with smart technology. There  is a virtual concierge that will greet you by name as you come in the front door and ask if you are formally checking in.  You will be given a menu of options, or you can ask exactly what you want. I have spent a great deal of time, programming information Such as info about the property , info on anything inside the flat and how to use it, restaurants, things to do, places to see, family friendly activities, hiking, shopping, etc...I have worked with many local restaurants and stores securing exclusive discount coupons for you, but you have to use the virtual concierge.  I have attached many pictures and videos,  of things in the flat that explain things better. So if you don't know how to make a pour over, it will teach you. 

I'm not going to list every little detail. I can only GUARANTEE you will not find anything like it locally, or for this price.  IF you do ill honor my guarantee and give you a weekend for free.

 I am also trying to set the bar for a different kind of service and go above and beyond. If you choose to book and will be staying at the flat long enough to need groceries, You can place a click list order and I will happily pick them up and have them stocked at the flat for you.  Local grocery store options are Kroger, Walmart, and Food Lion.

My father, myself, and generations in my family served in The United States Military. I am proud, and grateful  in offering a 15% military discount for Active Duty or former service members.  Please let me know before booking so that I can send you  the special offer. I would also ask that you provide some sort of verification.,  ie,  base card, VA ID, or DD214. You would want to think that no one would lie about serving in the military for a discount, but we all know better. This is actually a Federal crime punishable under The Stolen Valor Act of 2013 (revised from 2005).","Enjoy a stylish experience at this centrally-located flat, in the WVU Tech University District.

The kitchen is totally equipped with all the essentials, including crock pot, coffee maker, pots and pans, a built-in microwave, dishwasher and everything that you need for your vacation. 
The living room consists of an electric fireplace and a view out the sliding glass doors onto the slopes. The master bedroom has a queen bed with a bath and views onto the mountains. 
Everything you need to create great family memories! 
The condo has electric baseboard heaters in each room, so you can adjust the heat to the temperature that you prefer when it's cold outside. When it's hot, there is an AC unit installed in the living room above the couch. This is for AC only. We are not allowed to do duct work in the 2nd or 3rd floor condos, so this is the only practical way to get AC in the unit, leaving room doors open as often as possible helps to keep the whole condo cool.
Please be aware there will be a $200 security deposit that will be pre-authorized on your credit card the day before you arrive and is released 7 days after you depart unless there is damage. This is a standard practice for vacation home rentals as there is no staff at the facility and this allows you to check in with an electronic door code and check out by just texting us and leaving the morning of your last day.
Also, the road to the condos is a gravel, hilly, road that Winterplace Ski Resort is paid to take care of it. Sometimes through the year, we will have heavy rains that create ruts in the road and Winterplace Ski Resort, being closed, is slow in making the repairs. Low clearance vehicles will need to be very careful coming up the hill from Winterplace Ski Resort's main parking area. In the winter, they grade the road and keep it plowed and put cinders on the road but please be prepared and understand you may need a four wheel drive, all wheel drive or chains to help get up the hill.
We highly recommend that you purchase travel insurance. Problems can arise in multiple ways and travel insurance can be a low cost guard against losing your money if you have last minute problems and have to cancel. In the past, some of our guests have obtained insurance by going to www.InsureMyTrip.com for details and to purchase. We did call the people at InsuraneMyTrip and they do have plans that will cover for Covid issues but there are several important steps and needs to be done shortly after making your first deposit. The plans are called ""Cancel For Any Reason"" CFAR. Check with your insurance agent before deciding what insurance to purchase. We DO NOT endorse any insurance in particular.
~Long Term Stays ~
For those looking to stay for more than a week, the following changes apply:
- We only allow 3 people to stay per condo
- No pets allowed
- We do not provide daily maid service but will provide clean linens weekly.

The condo has electric baseboard heaters in each room, so you can adjust the heat to the temperature that you prefer when it's cold outside. When it's hot, there is an AC unit installed in the living room above the sliding glass door. This is for AC only. We are not allowed to do duct work in the 2nd or 3rd floor condos, so this is the only practical way to get AC in the unit, leaving room doors open as often as possible helps to keep the whole condo cool.
Please be aware there will be a $200 security deposit that will be pre-authorized on your credit card the day before you arrive and is released 7 days after you depart unless there is damage.

Also, the road to the condos is a gravel, hilly, road that Winterplace Ski Resort is paid to take care of it. Sometimes through the year, we will have heavy rains that create ruts in the road and Winterplace Ski Resort, being closed, is slow in making the repairs. Low clearance vehicles will need to be very careful coming up the hill from Winterplace Ski Resort's main parking area. In the winter, they grade the road and keep it plowed and put cinders on the road but please be prepared and understand you may need a four wheel drive, all wheel drive or chains to help get up the hill.
We highly recommend that you purchase travel insurance. Problems can arise in multiple ways and travel insurance can be a low cost guard against losing your money if you have last minute problems and have to cancel. In the past, some of our guests have obtained insurance by going to www.InsureMyTrip.com for details and to purchase. We did call the people at InsuraneMyTrip and they do have plans that will cover for Covid issues but there are several important steps and needs to be done shortly after making your first deposit. The plans are called ""Cancel For Any Reason"" CFAR. Check with your insurance agent before deciding what insurance to purchase. We DO NOT endorse any insurance in particular.

We have four (friendly) dogs so we will need to coordinate yard usage to avoid any possible problems. Please clean up after your pet! Pets may not be left unattended for more than 2 hours and must be in a kennel/travel carrier. If you need assistance finding a dog-sitter please contact your hosts ahead of time.
4. Trash cans and bags are provided in the Loft (under the sink in the kitchen and bathroom). If the cans get full during your stay, please take the trash out and put in one of the trash cans in, or by, the driveway. No need to take out the trash at the end of your stay.
5. No hair dying or coloring is permitted in the Loft.
6. We do not have child safety features; children are welcome if you accept liability and are comfortable knowing we have no child proofing along with many stairs.
7. Minors under the age of 18 must be accompanied, in person AT ALL TIMES, by an adult over 21. You must be 21 to book a reservation at the Loft.
8. The antler hooks by the door will not hold heavy loads. Please only hang light jackets and clothing on them.
9. Please clean your boots/shoes as well as you can before entering the building and use the boot tray upstairs by the door for your boots and shoes.
10. Please do not block neighbor’s driveways, including the apartment’s next door. We will do what we can to help you with parking (including our driveway and street parking in front of our house). Please let us know if you’re traveling with a trailer so we can help you plan for parking.
11. If you would like to sit outside, you are welcome to use the camp chairs at the bottom of the stairs. If it is raining or too sunny, feel free to sit under the carport by the house. If we are parked there, just send us a message during daytime hours (9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) and we’ll move our car: we want you to enjoy your stay! You can also sit in the backyard but be aware that our dogs will occasionally need to be let out. If you are using the yard and/or grill, we will check with you before letting out the dogs. When sitting outside after 9 p.m. please try to keep the noise down so as not to disturb the residents and neighbors.
12. Do not go out on the roof. While it looks like a great place to hang out, it’s not safe for people and walking on the shingles are likely to cause damage.
13. Without exception, no smoking, vaping or marijuana usage inside the Loft. Please don’t think it can be covered up, it cannot. We have to extensively clean to remove the contaminant before other guests can arrive. Neutralizing this contaminant inside requires a $100 minimum service fee. Feel free to step outside in the back yard and quietly enjoy a tobacco smoke or vape; you'll just need to police your butts.
14. Before you leave, please wash any dishes that you used. Clean dishes can be left in the drainer to dry and we’ll put them away.
15. No need to strip the bed or pile up used towels and washcloths upon departure but during your stay, please hang wet towels and washcloths on the towel racks, shower curtain rod or side of the bathtub.
16. Please lock the door at the bottom of the steps whenever you leave the premises, including your departure.

The Foggy Mountain Loft has the feel of a mountain hideaway but in town, close to where you want to play & eat. There's a private entrance to this simple guest loft above the garage behind our home. You'll find a basic kitchenette, full bathroom, Roku TV and WiFi. At over 50 years old, the Loft shows its age with multiple layers of paint and years of cosmetic repairs, but it has been recently renovated to create a safe, clean & comfortable space.

The Foggy Mountain Loft is a single L-shaped room which has a double bed, futon couch, and a full bathroom with bathtub and shower. You can use our Adirondack chairs to spend time outside or stay in and watch your streaming apps on the Roku TV. There isn't a stove or oven in the Loft but there is a microwave, coffee maker, hot water kettle, toaster, air fryer and electric skillet for simple food preparation, and a grill in the garage you can use upon request.  There are also many great restaurants in Logan just a few minutes away.

Foggy Mountain Loft is on a residential street near town with free on-street parking. If you're towing a trailer, we'll try to save the spaces in front of the house for you with prior arrangement or you can use our driveway. You'll have a private entrance to the Loft at the end of the driveway with access through a digital keypad deadbolt lock.

We're available during your stay for assistance or to answer questions but you'll have as much privacy as you're looking for.

Gas station (which usually has the cheapest gas in Logan) is just about a mile away (just past the coffee house and bakery...)!","This is a 2nd floor loft with a narrow staircase, so you'll need to keep an eye on small children and keep in mind your own ability to climb stairs.","The Foggy Mountain Loft is a single L-shaped room which has a double bed, futon couch, and a full bathroom with bathtub and shower. You can use our Adirondack chairs to spend time outside or stay in and watch your streaming apps on the Roku TV. There isn't a stove or oven in the Loft but there is a microwave, coffee maker, hot water kettle, toaster, air fryer and electric skillet for simple food preparation, and a grill in the garage you can use upon request.  There are also many great restaurants in Logan just a few minutes away.","Great place near Hatfield & McCoy trailheads! The Foggy Mountain Loft has the feel of a mountain hideaway but in town, close to where you want to play & eat. There's a private entrance to this simple guest loft above the garage behind our home. You'll find a basic kitchenette, full bathroom, Roku TV and WiFi. At over 50 years old, the Loft shows its age with multiple layers of paint and years of cosmetic repairs, but it has been recently renovated to create a safe, clean & comfortable space.","On street parking is easy to find near Foggy Mountain Loft. If you're raveling with a trailer you'll be able to find a spot within a couple blocks of the Loft. With prior arrangement, guests traveling with a trailer can have the parking spaces in front of  our house saved by us until their arrival or can park in the driveway (pulling truck into carport, there's room for a trailer with one ATV).","41","45","61","77","79","657","665",,,"pdp_m2_5_bathroom","","Bathroom","40","73","85","86",,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_bedroom_laundry","","Bedroom and laundry","1",,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_entertainment","","Entertainment","392",,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_family","","Family","5","30","139",,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_heating_cooling","","Heating and cooling","35","36","39",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_home_safety","","Home safety","4","47",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_internet_office","","Internet and office","8","89","90","91","93","94","137","146","236","251","308","476","626",,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_kitchen_dining","","Kitchen and dining","57","663",,,,,"pdp_m2_5_location","","Location features","99","101","280",,,,,"pdp_m2_5_outdoor","","Outdoor","9","23",,,,"pdp_m2_5_parking_facilities","","Parking and facilities","53","103","104",,"pdp_m2_5_services","","Services","33","34",,"pdp_unavailable","","Not included","false","4.95","WV","0","https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/47385627"

We manage four of five houses on the street which are used as Airbnb homes and corporate rentals, so know who your neighbors are.

There are three off-street parking spaces behind the house exclusively for guest use and plenty of extra parking across the street in business parking lots that agree to overnight and weekend usage. If a private driver is needed, please let us know, and we can help you make arrangements with a local Uber driver.

Quite neighborhood with two miles of walking trails, through the woods, on our property.
In St. Paul, Va. just about 7 miles away is the Sugar Hills ATV and hiking trails, and the newly remodeled ""Western Front"" with a nice Restaurant. Sugar Hill Brewery is also a great place to eat and experience local beer. 
The Hidden Valley Lake Area offers hiking, boating and fishing, and is just a few miles away. Fifteen- twenty miles away is The Channels, a majestic sandstone formation that is over 400-million years old. Great Hike !  The ""Devils Bath Tub"" is not to far away and a must see. The Pinnacle Natural Area Reserve is also very close and quite spectacular. The town of Abingdon (18 miles away) is a great little town with some excellent restaurants,  Wolf Hills Brewing Company, The Creeper Trail, The Barter Theater (state theater of Virginia!), biking and walking trails, festivals, and much more.

 You’ll experience the peace and tranquility of rural Southern West Virginia, while still being minutes away from the main attractions you are here to enjoy.

Though I grew up in South Florida, I loved my summers there away from the Florida heat. I hiked in the woods, swam in cold streams, explored waterfalls and fell in love. Being adventurous, I rapelled in the New River Gorge, skiied for the first time at Snowshoe and learned a love of rafting that continues today as I pursue trips on many Western Rivers in New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and Arizona.Life took me out west to Santa Fe, New Mexico where I pursued an art career and eventually a Real Estate career. I feel blessed to have helped my mother find her dream cabins, and to now again get to spend family time in this wonderful place. Many friends and family are still nearby and it is like coming “home” to stay at the cabins on Anam Cara Way.

We hope you will find joy, and peace, and feel that our home is your home when you stay at our sweet cabins.","121 Reviews","Identity verified","Danna","false","true","https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/306956733","306956733","true",,,,"2","Joined in November 2019","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/825f8b0d-ea09-410c-8cfd-cd4ab8b01478.jpg?aki_policy=profile_large","100%","within an hour","Danna","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/825f8b0d-ea09-410c-8cfd-cd4ab8b01478.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","3","0","70","Accuracy","4.8","0.962","10","Communication","4.9","0.982","10","Cleanliness","4.8","0.954","10","Location","4.9","0.982","10","Check-in","4.9","0.9720000000000001","10","Value","4.7","0.942","9","4.83","language_country","Entire cabin","entire_home","8","4","9","27","available_amenities","","Amenities",,,,,,,"human","The Whitetail is a conventional-style log cabin, cozy and appealing, with two bedrooms, two baths, living room, dining and kitchen; stone wood-burning fireplace, central A/C-heat.

This 53-acre property borders the Jefferson National Forest with private trails in a park like setting with small waterfalls throughout the property. An unparalleled place to relax from the daily grind but only a short, 15-minute drive to Wytheville, VA.

We are pet friendly with lots of room for you four-legged love ones to explore.
We charge a pet fee of $25 for the first pet per stay and $10 for each additional pet per stay. 
The pet fee is collected separately through AirBNB after the cabin is booked.

Water:  We are in a beautiful, rural location with well water; it has a sulphur smell to it.  Although, completely safe to drink and bathe in it has a strong smell many people are not accustomed to this so I like to let guests know upfront.  I leave a gallon of water in the cabin along with the breakfast basket but I always suggest guests bring plenty of water to cook with.

Wi-Fi: As mentioned above, this is a rural location which is great to decompress and find peace and quiet but high speed internet isn’t available in this area. We provide satellite internet, so guests can use Wi-Fi texting and calling (dependent on your cell provider- cell phone service is very limited), check emails and surf the web but streaming Netflix and downloading music unfortunately don’t work.  We have the highest amount of gigabytes available with HughesNet Satellite but once the data caps are reached(which is easy to do if streaming is tried and continues to buffer) the internet eventually stops.  We ask you to please be conscientious with the internet usage so all our guests are able to use it throughout their stay with us.

This place is so special and we want our guests to love it as much as we do so if there is anything we can do throughout your stay we are happy to help.

We are in a rural location; cell phone service is limited but we do have Hughesnet Satellite wi-fi, it doesn't stream video but allows for surfing the web, answering emails, wi-fi texting and calling(depending on you cell phone carrier plan).

As like many people in rural America we are on a well water system so the water has Sulphur, which is completely safe to drink and bath in but does have a Sulphur smell and is an acquired taste.  We supply a gallon of water but suggest our guests bring extra water for drinking due to the taste.","PLEASE HONOR 10AM CHECK-OUT

The kitchen is totally equipped with all the essentials, including crock pot, coffee maker, pots and pans, a built-in microwave, dishwasher and everything that you need for your vacation.
The living room consist of an electric fireplace and a view out the sliding glass doors onto the slopes. The master bedroom has a queen bed with a bath and views onto the mountains.
Everything you need to create great family memories!
The condo has electric baseboard heaters in each room, so you can adjust the heat to the temperature that you prefer when it's cold outside. When it's hot, there is an AC unit installed in the living room above the sliding glass door. This is for AC only. We are not allowed to do duct work in the 2nd or 3rd floor condos, so this is the only practical way to get AC in the unit, leaving room doors open as often as possible helps to keep the whole condo cool.
Please be aware there will be a $200 security deposit that will be pre-authorized on your credit card the day before you arrive and is released 7 days after you depart unless there is damage. This is a standard practice for vacation home rentals as there is no staff at the facility and this allows you to check in with an electronic door code and check out by just texting us and leaving the morning of your last day.
Also, the road to the condos is a gravel, hilly, road that Winterplace Ski Resort is paid to take care of it. Sometimes through the year, we will have heavy rains that create ruts in the road and Winterplace Ski Resort, being closed, is slow in making the repairs. Low clearance vehicles will need to be very careful coming up the hill from Winterplace Ski Resort's main parking area. In the winter, they grade the road and keep it plowed and put cinders on the road but please be prepared and understand you may need a four wheel drive, all wheel drive or chains to help get up the hill.
We highly recommend that you purchase travel insurance. Problems can arise in multiple ways and travel insurance can be a low cost guard against losing your money if you have last minute problems and have to cancel. In the past, some of our guests have obtained insurance by going to www.InsureMyTrip.com for details and to purchase. We did call the people at InsuraneMyTrip and they do have plans that will cover for Covid issues but there are several important steps and needs to be done shortly after making your first deposit. The plans are called ""Cancel For Any Reason"" CFAR. Check with your insurance agent before deciding what insurance to purchase. We DO NOT endorse any insurance in particular.

~Long Term Stays ~
For those looking to stay for more than a week, the following changes apply:
- We only allow 3 people to stay per condo
- No pets allowed
- We do not provide daily maid service but will provide clean linens weekly. 
Please contact us for further information.

Of course, there are all your favorite fast food and sit down restaurants, as well as some home-grown restaurants that might become your new favorites. There is a wide variety of different shops.

Everything you need to create great family memories!
The condo has electric baseboard heaters in each room, so you can adjust the heat to the temperature that you prefer when it's cold outside. When it's hot, there is an AC unit installed in the living room above the sliding glass door. This is for AC only. We are not allowed to do duct work in the 2nd or 3rd floor condos, so this is the only practical way to get AC in the unit, leaving room doors open as often as possible helps to keep the whole condo cool.
Please be aware there will be a $200 security deposit that will be pre-authorized on your credit card the day before you arrive and is released 7 days after you depart unless there is damage. This is a standard practice for vacation home rentals as there is no staff at the facility and this allows you to check in with an electronic door code and check out by just texting us and leaving the morning of your last day.
Also, the road to the condos is a gravel, hilly, road that Winterplace Ski Resort is paid to take care of it. Sometimes through the year, we will have heavy rains that create ruts in the road and Winterplace Ski Resort, being closed, is slow in making the repairs. Low clearance vehicles will need to be very careful coming up the hill from Winterplace Ski Resort's main parking area. In the winter, they grade the road and keep it plowed and put cinders on the road but please be prepared and understand you may need a four wheel drive, all wheel drive or chains to help get up the hill.
We highly recommend that you purchase travel insurance. Problems can arise in multiple ways and travel insurance can be a low cost guard against losing your money if you have last minute problems and have to cancel. In the past, some of our guests have obtained insurance by going to www.InsureMyTrip.com for details and to purchase. We did call the people at InsuraneMyTrip and they do have plans that will cover for Covid issues but there are several important steps and needs to be done shortly after making your first deposit. The plans are called ""Cancel For Any Reason"" CFAR. Check with your insurance agent before deciding what insurance to purchase. We DO NOT endorse any insurance in particular.

Please contact us for further information.

NEAR BECKLEY AND WHITEWATER COUNTRY
During the spring, summer and fall don’t think there is nothing to do. We are close to all the fun that southern West Virginia has to offer. Whitewater rafting, kayaking, river tubing, rock climbing, hiking, horseback riding etc. All different kinds of outdoor fun are waiting for you to take advantage of. There are several state and national parks near by, like Little Beaver State Park and Grandview National Park. We are also near Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve. The temperature in the mountains of West Virginia remains cooler than a lot of the surrounding states, so this is great place to come cool off. Enjoy something different from the beach, take your family out into nature.
And for anytime of the year fun, Beckley has something for everyone. Of course, there are all your favorite fast food and sit down restaurants, as well as some home-grown restaurants that might become your new favorites. There is a wide variety of different shops. The Tamarackhas everything you might want to see from our unique West Virginia craftsman. There are a lot of different antique shops and Crossroads Mall for those that might want something a little familiar. There is the Beckley Exhibition Coal Mine, where you can tour an actual coal mine and let the kids explore the coal mining town and the Youth Museum. During good weather, there are also trails, playground, basketball and tennis courts and a pool with a waterslide. There is also, Mountain State Miniature Golfwhich doesn’t have just mini-golf but offers a small coffee shop and an indoor climbing wall. Beckley is a great place to spend a few days exploring all it has to offer and it’s only a quick drive up Interstate 77.",,"45",,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_bathroom","","Bathroom","46","34","40","85",,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_bedroom_laundry","","Bedroom and laundry","2","1",,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_entertainment","","Entertainment","27","30","5",,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_heating_cooling","","Heating and cooling","35","37","39",,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_home_safety","","Home safety","4",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_internet_office","","Internet and office","89","90","91","92","94","95","251",,,,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_kitchen_dining","","Kitchen and dining","9",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_parking_facilities","","Parking and facilities","52",,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_services","","Services","8","33","36","77",,,,"pdp_unavailable","","Not included",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"false","4.67","WV","0","https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/36652891"

This is a former coal company superintendent's house built in the  1920s when Glen Jean  was a coal boom town. The property is ideally located in the New River Gorge - minutes from whitewater rafting, National Park activities, The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve and rails-to-trails paths.

You're also a short drive to Fayetteville (voted one of America's coolest small towns), Beckley (a local commercial hub), and Oak Hill. At the house, you'll find most of your time spent on the very large covered side porch, by the designated fire pit area, or in the backyard playing badminton, cornhole and croquet. Inside you'll find all original wood flooring, a wide, wood staircase, three sets of French Doors connecting all of the main areas, and large rooms perfect for entertaining. With the home's pre-war construction, you'll have a classic mix of old West Virginia's historic charm but with spacious rooms, high ceilings and large windows -- especially good for letting in the cool night air (as Glen Jean is on the Fayette Plateau, evenings consistently drop to the mid 60s each night, even when afternoon temps are in the traditional summer ranges of the 70s to 80s.) After driving up the approximately 200 yard long private, tree-lined paved drive to the hilltop, you'll treat yourself to large accommodations including a spacious living room, dining room, TV room and you'll have access to a full size garage to keep your gear out of the elements. And there's no need to keep your music low as the neighbors are out of earshot.

Our home was recently featured in an issue of Teen Vogue.

Guests can access the entire home with the exception of the basement.

I will be available by phone.

This property is fairly out of the way (but not too far off of U.S. Route 19) and you will have plenty of open space. We are about 10 miles from the New River, about a mile or so from The Summit Bechtel Reserve and a literal stone's throw from Camp Royal and about 14 miles from Fayetteville and most of the White Water Rafting Outfitters. We are 25 minutes away from Winterplace.","Quiet hours after midnight, but we won't be super picky.

Try this condo in our off season (spring - fall) and enjoy a quiet place when your not out exploring WV. In winter, ski in and  out from this condo onto the slopes of Winterplace Ski Resort. This condo is located on the second floor and the deck overlooks the 'Last Chance' and 'Last Run' trails. It is also close to Beckley and Princeton, Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve and southern WV whitewater country. During the ski season, we offer discounted equipment rentals from Ski Celebrations for all of our guests.
The condo sleeps up to 10, great for a large family or a couple of small families with separate bathrooms or for those that just want some space and privacy that you can't get in a hotel. Private deck to enjoy the views from.

~ Views of Winterplace Ski Resort
The kitchen is totally equipped with all the essentials, including crock pot, coffee maker, pots and pans, a built-in microwave, dishwasher and everything that you need for your vacation. 
The living room consist of an electric fireplace and a view out the sliding glass doors onto the slopes. The master bedroom has a queen bed with a bath and views onto the mountains.
Everything you need to create great family memories!
The condo has electric baseboard heaters in each room, so you can adjust the heat to the temperature that you prefer when it's cold outside. When it's hot, there is an AC unit installed in the living room above the sliding glass door. This is for AC only. We are not allowed to do duct work in the 2nd or 3rd floor condos, so this is the only practical way to get AC in the unit, leaving room doors open as often as possible helps to keep the whole condo cool.
Please be aware there will be a $200 security deposit that will be pre-authorized on your credit card the day before you arrive and is released 7 days after you depart unless there is damage. This is a standard practice for vacation home rentals as there is no staff at the facility and this allows you to check in with an electronic door code and check out by just texting us and leaving the morning of your last day.
Also, the road to the condos is a gravel, hilly, road that Winterplace Ski Resort is paid to take care of it. Sometimes through the year, we will have heavy rains that create ruts in the road and Winterplace Ski Resort, being closed, is slow in making the repairs. Low clearance vehicles will need to be very careful coming up the hill from Winterplace Ski Resort's main parking area. In the winter, they grade the road and keep it plowed and put cinders on the road but please be prepared and understand you may need a four wheel drive, all wheel drive or chains to help get up the hill.
We highly recommend that you purchase travel insurance. Problems can arise in multiple ways and travel insurance can be a low cost guard against losing your money if you have last minute problems and have to cancel. In the past, some of our guests have obtained insurance by going to www.InsureMyTrip.com for details and to purchase. We did call the people at InsuraneMyTrip and they do have plans that will cover for Covid issues but there are several important steps and needs to be done shortly after making your first deposit. The plans are called ""Cancel For Any Reason"" CFAR. Check with your insurance agent before deciding what insurance to purchase. We DO NOT endorse any insurance in particular.
~Long Term Stays ~
For those looking to stay for more than a week, the following changes apply:
- We only allow 3 people to stay per condo
- No pets allowed
- We do not provide daily maid service but will provide clean linens weekly. 
Please contact us for further information.

Whitewater rafting, kayaking, river tubing, rock climbing, hiking, horseback riding etc. All different kinds of outdoor fun are waiting for you to take advantage of.There are several state and national parks near by, like Little Beaver State Parkand Grandview National Park. We are also near Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve. The temperature in the mountains of West Virginia remains cooler than a lot of the surrounding states, so this is great place to come cool off. Enjoy something different from the beach, take your family out into nature.

Of course, there are all your favorite fast food and sit down restaurants, as well as some home-grown restaurants that might become your new favorites. There is a wide variety of different shops. The Tamarackhas everything you might want to see from our unique West Virginia craftsman. There are a lot of different antique shops and Crossroads Mall for those that might want something a little familiar. There is the Beckley Exhibition Coal Mine, where you can tour an actual coal mine and let the kids explore the coal mining town and the Youth Museum. During good weather, there are also trails, playground, basketball and tennis courts and a pool with a waterslide. There is also, Mountain State Miniature Golfwhich doesn’t have just mini-golf but offers a small coffee shop and an indoor climbing wall.

The living room consist of an electric fireplace and a view out the sliding glass doors onto the slopes. The master bedroom has a queen bed with a bath and views onto the mountains.
Everything you need to create great family memories!
The condo has electric baseboard heaters in each room, so you can adjust the heat to the temperature that you prefer when it's cold outside. When it's hot, there is an AC unit installed in the living room above the sliding glass door. This is for AC only. We are not allowed to do duct work in the 2nd or 3rd floor condos, so this is the only practical way to get AC in the unit, leaving room doors open as often as possible helps to keep the whole condo cool.
Please be aware there will be a $200 security deposit that will be pre-authorized on your credit card the day before you arrive and is released 7 days after you depart unless there is damage. This is a standard practice for vacation home rentals as there is no staff at the facility and this allows you to check in with an electronic door code and check out by just texting us and leaving the morning of your last day.
Also, the road to the condos is a gravel, hilly, road that Winterplace Ski Resort is paid to take care of it. Sometimes through the year, we will have heavy rains that create ruts in the road and Winterplace Ski Resort, being closed, is slow in making the repairs. Low clearance vehicles will need to be very careful coming up the hill from Winterplace Ski Resort's main parking area. In the winter, they grade the road and keep it plowed and put cinders on the road but please be prepared and understand you may need a four wheel drive, all wheel drive or chains to help get up the hill.
We highly recommend that you purchase travel insurance. Problems can arise in multiple ways and travel insurance can be a low cost guard against losing your money if you have last minute problems and have to cancel. In the past, some of our guests have obtained insurance by going to www.InsureMyTrip.com for details and to purchase. We did call the people at InsuraneMyTrip and they do have plans that will cover for Covid issues but there are several important steps and needs to be done shortly after making your first deposit. The plans are called ""Cancel For Any Reason"" CFAR. Check with your insurance agent before deciding what insurance to purchase. We DO NOT endorse any insurance in particular.
~Long Term Stays ~
For those looking to stay for more than a week, the following changes apply:
- We only allow 3 people to stay per condo
- No pets allowed
- We do not provide daily maid service but will provide clean linens weekly. 
Please contact us for further information.

This property offers privacy and security for your family as well as your vehicles & UTV's. Not only is it perfect for UTV enthusiasts but families as well!

We typically let guests do self check in, sometimes my husband does like to meet the guests if he’s available when they arrive. We are here should any issues occur.

The cabin is close to the town but still secluded, a 24 hour gas station and restaurants are very close by.

The driveway is steep, any guest with a trailer will need a 4 wheel drive. Any large trailer will need to park on the flat right below the driveway. A 4wd is typically preferred but many cars have made it with no trouble. During the winter months of snow/ice should be present, access to the cabin could be difficult but parking and walking up is an option that others have done. We just like to make guests aware before arrival so they use their judgement.","See Rental Agreement for further info","We typically let guests do self check in, sometimes my husband does like to meet the guests if he’s available when they arrive.

Plenty of open space. Enjoy the mountain air. Close to the new Hatfield McCoy Warrior Trail.  Unload and you won’t have to haul your ATV/UTV again until you head home.  Many outlaw trails nearby. Right off Rt16.  

If you like riding curves on  motorcycles or sports cars we’re only 30 minutes from Back of the Dragon Visitors Center. 15 minutes to Berwind Lake. A great place to get away from it all!!

No access to attached garage.

Although this beautiful property isn't far from restaurants and stores you will feel like you are a world away. This 3400 sq foot, 4 bedroom, 3 bath home is situated on 53 private acres bordering the Jefferson National Forest.   Enjoy private trails throughout the property. When daylight fades share stories with your family around a roaring campfire.   The lodge has a new filtration system for sulfur-free water.

The lodge has 4 bedrooms and a spacious loft overlooking the living room with full size bed, twin trundle bed and futon.  There is a bedroom upstairs with twin and toddler bed.  The king size master bedroom upstairs has a private bathroom.  The second king size bedroom located downstairs overlooks the creek as well as another bedroom downstairs with a full size bed.  The game room on the first floor has a futon sofa bed.

We are in a rural location; cell phone service is limited but we do have Hughesnet Satellite wi-fi, it doesn't stream video but allows for surfing the web, answering emails, wi-fi texting and calling(depending on you cell phone carrier plan).

As like many people in rural America we are on a well water system so the water has Sulphur, which is completely safe to drink and bath in but does have a Sulphur smell and is an acquired taste.  We supply a gallon of water but suggest our guests bring extra water for drinking due to the taste.

We are one hour from Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA and 55 minutes to Radford University.

We are pet friendly with lots of room for your pets to explore.
We charge a pet fee of $25 for the first pet per stay and $10 for each additional pet per stay. 

The pet fee is collected separately through AirBNB after the cabin is booked.

* Don't forget to bring your water shoes, folding chairs, beach towels and sunscreen.

***Please read below***

*The lodge has a neighboring cottage for rent on Airbnb, approximately 70 feet from the lodge called The Cottage on Little Creek (please see gallery for photo that shows proximity.


* Wi-Fi: 
As mentioned above, this is a rural location which is great to decompress and find peace and quiet but high-speed internet isn’t available in this area. We provide satellite internet, so guests can use Wi-Fi texting and calling (dependent on your cell provider- cell phone service is very limited), check emails and surf the web but streaming Netflix and downloading music unfortunately don’t work.  We have the highest number of gigabytes available with HughesNet Satellite but once the data caps are reached (which is easy to do if streaming is tried and continues to buffer) the internet eventually stops.  We ask you to please be conscientious with the internet usage, so all our guests are able to use it throughout their stay with us.

This place is so special, and we want our guests to love it as much as we do so if there is anything we can do throughout your stay we are happy to help.","PLEASE HONOR 10AM CHECK-OUT

When I vacation in the mountains, I like to feel very comfortable ! From the minute that I arrive, I want to feel like I'm vacationing in my second home. I don't want to check-in at an office, and then go park my car far away from me. I want a place that has easy access to me unloading all of my luggage, groceries, skis, snowboard, and kids!

Linens are provided but please bring your own towels.

The house sleeps at least 15+ people. There is a bedroom on the main level with a queen bed. There is a sleeper sofa in the living room. The upstairs has two bedrooms.  One has a king bed and the other room has a queen bed and a full bed. In the finished basement there is currently two twin beds and two full beds. There is also some room in the basement for some air mattresses if needed.

Linens are provided but towels are not.

We highly recommend that you purchase travel insurance. Problems can arise in multiple ways and travel insurance can be a low cost guard against losing your money if you have last minute problems and have to cancel. In the past, some of our guests have obtained insurance by going to various insurance sites for details and to purchase. We did call the people at InsureMyTrip and they do have plans that will cover for Covid issues but there are several important steps and needs to be done shortly after making your first deposit. The plans are called ""Cancel For Any Reason"" CFAR. Check with your insurance agent before deciding what insurance to purchase. We DO NOT endorse any insurance in particular.","No pets.

Come relax in our farm front retreat.  Nestled in the Blue Ridge Highlands of the Appalachian Mountains this country cottage is centrally located to the best of Southwest Virginia.  Private, yet only a 15 minute drive to Abingdon, Emory and Henry College, Meadowview, Glade Spring and Saltville.  About a 35 minute drive to Bristol, Marion and Damascus.  A great home base to take in a show at the Barter Theatre, explore the ice age finds of Saltville, hike the Great Channels, or see the wild ponies at Grayson Highlands just to name a few.  Savor the view of the blue mountains from your front porch!  Enjoy the beautiful hardwood floors throughout this home, with tile in the 2.5 bathrooms.  The three bedrooms have a total of five beds.  Free Wi-Fi is provided.  The lower level is an unfinished basement where you may store your bicycles, kayaks, etc.  Just outside you will find a fire pit with chairs.  You can either walk up the front porch steps or drive around back which takes you to the first level.  This level boasts a dining room, a fully stocked kitchen, a living room with leather couches and tv with Netflix, storage closets and a half bath with washer and dryer.  The master bedroom is on this level with a king sized bed, his and hers closets, and a full bathroom.  The second level has a small sitting area with divan and a full bathroom.  There are two bedrooms, each with a queen sized bed and also a full sized bed, with large closets.  While outside you may get a visit from Rocky, the farm dog, who loves people.  The driveway is gravel.  If you choose to leave the front porch (you may not) you are welcome to hike through the woods or contact us to see some farm animals.  For an additional fee, we will fulfill special requests, don’t hesitate to ask.  We are also happy to make recommendations.  Absolutely no smoking, no pets.  No hidden fees, a flat rate of $250 per night, plus county/state tax and airbnb fees.  The mountains are calling…

Our home is also on the farm, so we are readily available for your needs.

Our retreat is unique in that it is rural yet close to many areas of interest.  Take the Barter Theatre, for instance, which is the longest running professional theatre in the nation.  If you enjoy hiking, you could visit the Great Channels which is a sandstone maze formed 400 million years ago.  There is much more, we love to make recommendations so please don't hesitate to ask!","Upon arrival please read the house manual located in a white binder on the kitchen table.

As native Appalachians, my husband and I have a deep love for this region and its people and the tradition of hospitality.  We are both artists of sorts--I'm a freelance writer/reporter and he is a rock 'n roll keyboard player and works in the local school system. And we manage a herd of dairy goats, mostly LaMancha breed. All with names and personalities. Our place is about 15-20  minutes off off I-77. We're close to the notable ""Back of the Dragon"" motorcycle routes. And very close to some beautiful backroad bicycle routes. The scenery is beautiful all seasons of the year but especially the fall. We hope you'll visit!

 As for the goats, they are ""the greatest entertainers and the greatest time wasters"" as my dad used to say. He was a vet and built the house as a home and office. So it has a sort of historic/museum feel in certain sections. 

We don't guarantee food as part of our Airbnb listing,  but I love to cook and if I'm cooking, you're welcome to join us if you don't have other plans. 

Last but not least, we  love to know a little about our guests beforehand so PLEASE make sure you fill out the ""Describe Yourself"" questions under the Airbnb profile section to speed along the booking process.

Our cabin is  located on 8 acres of property and full  of various types of wildlife.  Sometimes, you will see bear, deer, wild turkey, and squirrels. We also live on the property, but the cabin is private and  tucked away within the beautiful whispering pines.

. The interior has recently been updated with appliances and decor including farmhouse style. The exterior of the cabin has also been recently renovated. There is a  peaceful fire pit for your family to enjoy.  You will need an All Wheel Drive (AWD) or Four -Wheel Drive vehicle (4x4) in order to drive all the way to the cabin because the incline is a little steep for a 2 wheel drive. There  is a parking lot at the top of this incline for all the Non-AWD and Non-4x4 vehicles.  Please note, you will only have to walk approximately 75 yards down the hill to the cabin. The other Parking lot is at the bottom. Upon request, a pack & play can be provided for your baby or toddler. The cabin is NOT wheelchair accessible and has NO WIFI! Cell service is limited to Verizon, however AT&T will pick up 1 bar and LTE. The cabin has No cable TV; however, there is a 42 inch TV available with multi-selection DVDs for adults and children.  We have also included a selection of books for adults and children. Our property has 2 ponds,  a mid-sized refrigerator, sink, dishes, pots/pans,  silverware, cooking utensils, and a Keurig coffee pot. Enjoy your evening sitting by the firepit or gazebo by the pond. Although, our water source is from freshwater springs, we do advise not to drink, to be on the safe side; however you can boil the water for drinking and cooking. We will provide each guest with one bottle of drinking water.  Whispering Pines cabin is sparkling clean and  very quiet with a peaceful rustic setting.

Room #8 - The Colonel May Room (Shared Bathroom)

The Colonel May room is dedicated to the youngest son of Andrew Jackson and Nelle May. Andrew named his son “Colonel” in hopes to pass along some of the luster and reputation of his own name. This room is fit for a Colonel and styled for one too. With all the furnishings being dark, rich mahogany, and walnut. A favorite talking piece of this room is the beautiful stone capped foot boards. And of course, the guests who stay in this room are in love with the upper porch located just a few steps outside the room door, perfect for enjoying and relaxing.","HOUSE RULES & OCCUPANCY:

Take in small town vibe at First Friday in Marion.  Enjoy hot tub, ping pong, billiards, croquet, or lolling by the river.  Welcome!  Come enjoy!

The River House is a gorgeous, quiet getaway perched sublimely on the banks of the South Fork of the mighty Holston River in the Adwolfe area of pastoral Smyth County, Virginia.  Nestled peacefully on five hundred feet of this state-hatchery supported trout stream, you’ll find your cares slipping into oblivion regardless of which riverside Adirondack chair or seat in the hot tub you pick.  Here time disappears as your rhythm changes with days dissolving into dusk, sunsets become sunrises and back again.  The sound of the river will resonate in your soul.  Perfectly placed on a private triangle of land, it commands hundreds of feet on the river.  And if you need anything you’re equidistant to Marion or Chilhowie, and even closer to Jefferson National Forest, Mount Rogers, and Grayson Highlands State Park.  

Once you’re acclimated to the serene sounds and sights of this constantly coursing stream, you’ll grow to love the subtle and supple quality of The River House.  Pulling into the driveway you’ll come first to the covered porch with several seating spaces for those times when the rain washes the valley.  Off to the right, along the riverbank is a raised deck, jutting out over the stream.  Further down the bank, are a row of inviting Adirondack chairs.  As I am in this narrative, you’ll find yourself irresistibly drawn to the outside because of its unique, natural power and beauty.  But come inside for a minute.  Let’s cross the threshold.  Here’s a modest but updated kitchen, replete with a coffee bar beside the front door to accommodate company in the kitchen. From the kitchen window you’ll see a wonderful view of the river wending its way north.  Looking left, you’ll see a generous, sunny family room with a café table and six chairs, an exquisite, tufted, Cordovan leather sofa, matching chair, and daybed with trundle for an extra two sleeping berths.  Sink your bare feet into the burgundy wool and silk Persian carpet.  Walk through this sunny space and you’ll enter the hallway to the sleeping quarters.  On the right is the master bedroom appointed with a stout, king-sized furniture suite, another exquisite Persian carpet and carved floral love seat.  Across the hall is the guest bedroom with another compelling queen set.  Our choice of bedding is the Frontgate Resort line.  Linens are from Macy’s Hotel Collection.  Bedding is dried “en plein air,” so you’ll slumber in fragrant mountain sunshine.   We don’t want to anesthetize you, but you’ll love your slumber as much as your waking hours!  

Let’s step down to the lower level and see what’s going on there.  Taking the staircase from the kitchen, we alight on the lower level.  We think you’ll be delighted with the 8’ Brunswick billiards table appointed nicely with a green and buff Tiffany-style billiards light overhead.  Adjacent is an intimate two-chair café table, and wide-screen opposite.  Especially in inclement weather this is another nice and separate gathering space.  We make it easy for folks to converge and diverge. 

Back through the kitchen we come to the large gathering room with full bath.  Quietly dominating this space is a scarlet Bokhara Persian carpet – truly art underfoot.  The generous leather furnishings, glow of the fireplace and overall ambiance may invite you to linger longer than you intended.  In cold weather you’ll love the fireplace radiating warmth and light.  With the spa towels and robes in the nearby armoire, it’s tempting to take a turn in the hot tub.  

Open the patio doors and step out onto the open deck.  Out here you’re going to find your senses beset by a panoply of natural amenities competing for your attention.  You’ll see and hear the unique sounds of the river, the trees waving across green meadows in the wafting wind.  Depending upon how your day has gone, you may just decide to plop down here on the patio to relax and decide what to do next.  That may constitute nothing more than enjoying the experience of the The River House. This open deck is a natural gathering place for sitting, talking, eating and engaging with friends and family surrounded by nature’s bounty and beauty.

Or, grab your towels and robes and head for the spa.  Follow the sidewalk to the Jacuzzi six-person spa with lighting, aqua massage jets for a moment of pure relaxation on the banks of the Holston River letting the water work its wonder.  Others may prefer relaxing on the river-bank in one of the Adirondack chairs.  Recline in these comfy seats and contemplate nothing more than the moving waters.  Or light a campfire in the copper pit or carry a basket of goodies down to the picnic table.  For group lawn games, you can choose between ping-pong, croquet or bocce ball.  You can also access the adjacent storage building with ping pong table and comfortable sofas. 
Here you’ll find three easy-mount bicycles for pure holiday fun.  And if you’d rather hike, we’re happy to provide a trail map to some of the prettier vantage points on our adjacent 240 acres.  You can easily hike 1-5 miles and picnic out in the open with some of Smyth County’s most spectacular views.  Check out our trail maps.  Did we mention trout fishing!  And you can also content yourselves streaming video inside or roaming around outside with our wi-fi music speaker.  Just come have fun!

As you can see, The River House is an experience waiting to unfold beautifully and uniquely for all of our guests.  Hungry Mother State Park, Virginia Highlands Festival, Mount Rogers Naturalist Rally, Virginia Creeper Trail, Virginia Highlands Horse Trail, Appalachian Trail - endless opportunities for adventure are just minutes away.  Experience an outdoor adventure or quiet serenity.  Embrace togetherness or seek your own solitude.

Adwolfe is a picturesque pastoral valley in the lea of Flat Ridge section of Iron Mountain adjacent historic Mount Rogers.  The valley is dominated by the South Fork of the mighty Holston River, a state hatchery supported trout fishing destination.  The peace and quite may be overwhelming to city dwellers.

The valley is dominated by the South Fork of the mighty Holston River, a state hatchery supported trout fishing destination.  The peace and quite may be overwhelming to city dwellers.

Where ever your senses carry you, we hope your river house experience will culminate in life-long memories of fun and affection shared with family and friends.",,"The River House is a gorgeous, quiet getaway perched sublimely on the banks of the South Fork of the mighty Holston River in the Adwolfe area of pastoral Smyth County, Virginia.  Nestled peacefully on five hundred feet of this state-hatchery supported trout stream, you’ll find your cares slipping into oblivion regardless of which riverside Adirondack chair or seat in the hot tub you pick.  Here time disappears as your rhythm changes with days dissolving into dusk, sunsets become sunrises and back again.  The sound of the river will resonate in your soul.  Perfectly placed on a private triangle of land, it commands hundreds of feet on the river.  And if you need anything you’re equidistant to Marion or Chilhowie, and even closer to Jefferson National Forest, Mount Rogers, and Grayson Highlands State Park.  

Once you’re acclimated to the serene sounds and sights of this constantly coursing stream, you’ll grow to love the subtle and supple quality of The River House.  Pulling into the driveway you’ll come first to the covered porch with several seating spaces for those times when the rain washes the valley.  Off to the right, along the riverbank is a raised deck, jutting out over the stream.  Further down the bank, are a row of inviting Adirondack chairs.  As I am in this narrative, you’ll find yourself irresistibly drawn to the outside because of its unique, natural power and beauty.  But come inside for a minute.  Let’s cross the threshold.  Here’s a modest but updated kitchen, replete with a coffee bar beside the front door to accommodate company in the kitchen. From the kitchen window you’ll see a wonderful view of the river wending its way north.  Looking left, you’ll see a generous, sunny family room with a café table and six chairs, an exquisite, tufted, Cordovan leather sofa, matching chair, and daybed with trundle for an extra two sleeping berths.  Sink your bare feet into the burgundy wool and silk Persian carpet.  Walk through this sunny space and you’ll enter the hallway to the sleeping quarters.  On the right is the master bedroom appointed with a stout, king-sized furniture suite, another exquisite Persian carpet and carved floral love seat.  Across the hall is the guest bedroom with another compelling queen set.  Our choice of bedding is the Frontgate Resort line.  Linens are from Macy’s Hotel Collection.  Bedding is dried “en plein air,” so you’ll slumber in fragrant mountain sunshine.   We don’t want to anesthetize you, but you’ll love your slumber as much as your waking hours!  

Let’s step down to the lower level and see what’s going on there.  Taking the staircase from the kitchen, we alight on the lower level.  We think you’ll be delighted with the 8’ Brunswick billiards table appointed nicely with a green and buff Tiffany-style billiards light overhead.  Adjacent is an intimate two-chair café table, and wide-screen opposite.  Especially in inclement weather this is another nice and separate gathering space.  We make it easy for folks to converge and diverge. 

Back through the kitchen we come to the large gathering room with full bath.  Quietly dominating this space is a scarlet Bokhara Persian carpet – truly art underfoot.  The generous leather furnishings, glow of the fireplace and overall ambiance may invite you to linger longer than you intended.  In cold weather you’ll love the fireplace radiating warmth and light.  With the spa towels and robes in the nearby armoire, it’s tempting to take a turn in the hot tub.  

Open the patio doors and step out onto the open deck.  Out here you’re going to find your senses beset by a panoply of natural amenities competing for your attention.  You’ll see and hear the unique sounds of the river, the trees waving across green meadows in the wafting wind.  Depending upon how your day has gone, you may just decide to plop down here on the patio to relax and decide what to do next.  That may constitute nothing more than enjoying the experience of the The River House. This open deck is a natural gathering place for sitting, talking, eating and engaging with friends and family surrounded by nature’s bounty and beauty.

Or, grab your towels and robes and head for the spa.  Follow the sidewalk to the Jacuzzi six-person spa with lighting, aqua massage jets for a moment of pure relaxation on the banks of the Holston River letting the water work its wonder.  Others may prefer relaxing on the river-bank in one of the Adirondack chairs.  Recline in these comfy seats and contemplate nothing more than the moving waters.  Or light a campfire in the copper pit or carry a basket of goodies down to the picnic table.  For group lawn games, you can choose between ping-pong, croquet or bocce ball.  You can also access the adjacent storage building with ping pong table and comfortable sofas. 
Here you’ll find three easy-mount bicycles for pure holiday fun.  And if you’d rather hike, we’re happy to provide a trail map to some of the prettier vantage points on our adjacent 240 acres.  You can easily hike 1-5 miles and picnic out in the open with some of Smyth County’s most spectacular views.  Check out our trail maps.  Did we mention trout fishing!  And you can also content yourselves streaming video inside or roaming around outside with our wi-fi music speaker.  Just come have fun!

As you can see, The River House is an experience waiting to unfold beautifully and uniquely for all of our guests.  Hungry Mother State Park, Virginia Highlands Festival, Mount Rogers Naturalist Rally, Virginia Creeper Trail, Virginia Highlands Horse Trail, Appalachian Trail - endless opportunities for adventure are just minutes away.  Experience an outdoor adventure or quiet serenity.  Embrace togetherness or seek your own solitude.  However, you choose to personalize your own River House revels, we hope you leave with memories for a lifetime and long to return to do it all over again!  When you return to reacquaint yourselves with its magic, we’ll have everything ready and waiting for you.

I am formerly from Bluefield WV and this home sits on my family farm.  Materials for the home was farmed from the surrounding property, milled on my fathers sawmill and loving crafted.  The hard wood floors were reclaimed from an old local store from the early 1900's.  

I love to travel and when I do I look for the places where I can live like a local.  I want to step back, meet the people, eat the food and see what it really means to live ""there"".  

This home is nothing fancy.  If you are looking for upscale accommodations - this is not it.  This is my country retreat - a place I go to sit on the porch, listen to the frogs, build a fire outside or take a walk in the woods.","155 Reviews","Identity verified","Lisa","false","true","https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/254295049","254295049","true",,,,"1","Joined in April 2019","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/7675a6a6-cff6-45cb-9bc5-9db955c84209.jpg?aki_policy=profile_large","100%","within an hour","Lisa","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/7675a6a6-cff6-45cb-9bc5-9db955c84209.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","1","0","155","Accuracy","5.0","0.994","10","Communication","5.0","0.998","10","Cleanliness","4.9","0.9800000000000001","10","Location","4.9","0.982","10","Check-in","5.0","0.998","10","Value","4.9","0.984","10","4.97","language_country","Entire home","entire_home","8","4","9","27","available_amenities","","Amenities",,,,,,,"human","Take a step back to the Heart of Appalachia on a farm that has been in my family for the last 75 years.

Guests can contact me through email, text or call my phone.

Children play in the road so drive slowly on Quail Rd. Sometimes the neighbor's little dog will come up the driveway. He is a friendly dog.

Trailers enter at the upper, left gravel driveway and exit at the lower driveway.  Stay on the gravel especially with wet weather because the ground is slippery on the hillside. Don't park in front of the house.  You can drive your ATV on the gravel behind the house and unload at the patio.","Please drive very slow on our road because of children in the neighborhood.
Stay off the grass as much as possible. It will become slippery in rainy/snowy conditions.
Bag all trash and take out to the wooden box. 
If you park your SxS behind the house, be careful not to run into the propane tank. 
Quiet hours are between 12pm and 6am.","Guests can contact me through email, text or call my phone.","en","English","Adventure Rentals near Pocahontas HMT Bluewell","Children play in the road so drive slowly on Quail Rd.

Located in a gated community called Cove Creek which consists of many  large acre properties and very little development.  Several trails located directly on the property for atv riding and hiking.  The community is atv friendly and also boasts a beautiful creek containing brook trout and picturesque waterfall.  Winterplace , Hatfield Mccoy Trails, and Appalachian trail all only minutes away.

There are many things that make this cabin unique.  First, it's  a  1,200 sq foot 3 bedroom fully equipped cozy cabin property on 18 acres and has breathtaking mountaintop views and private access to our own trails for hiking and ATV'ing.  It's also centrally located to several well known mountain adventure places for White water rafting, Skiiing, ATV'ing, Hiking, and much more.  We moderately priced this so that families, couples, and friend groups alike can take advantage of it.  We have wood logs on the property for the fireplace that can be chopped and usually there is some already there.  While you feel like your in complete solitude at the top of the south side it's nice to know you have easy access to many amenities (grocery stores, restaurants, movie theater, etc) in the city of Bluefield, VA: located just minutes from the bottom of the northside of the mountain.

You have access to the whole cabin and the trails on the property as well as the trail that goes to my brothers property that can be hiked or used by ATV's.  You also have access to the private community waterfall.

We are in florida but have a property manager that is there for housing needs and/or emergencies.  I pride myself of communication and maximizing your experience.  Email or text me for any details anytime.

The cabin is located inside of a gated, sparsely populated community called cove creek.  Guests have access to the Creek which has trout and a beautiful waterfall.  The city of bluefield and Tazewell are mintues away and have many restaurants, grociery stores, and your basic amenities (there's a walmart...lol).  Also within driving distance are great adventure places like the Hatfield Mccoy ATV Trails, Appalachian Trail for hiking, Winter Place ski resort,  AceRaft for white water and many  parks with waterfalls like pipestem and the cascades.  The property itself is 18 acres and has several trails on it for hiking and atv'ing.

If it’s not snowing any car can be used to get up and down the mountain.  However if more then 2-4 inches snow is in the forecast we highly recommend 4 wheel drive.  Also, the driveway can be tough to get up and down if you aren’t use to driving in the mountains.  I can do it in a Prius as long as it’s not snowing but I have experience. Biggest hint is stick to the left side when going up. There is additional parking at the coldesac on top of the driveway if you want to play it safe

*It takes about 15-20 minutes to go up or down the mountain depending on your vehicle, what your towing, and comfortableness in mountain driving.  
*Hatfielld Mccoy trails are about 15-45 minutes from the bottom depending on which trailhead you access.  as of right now you can not access directly by ATV.
*WinterPlace is 39 miles from the bottom of the mountain and takes about 30 minutes.
*5 miles from Appalachian Trail and can actually view the mountain ridge it passes through from the cabin. 
*""The Back og the Dragon"" Trail for motorcycles is close but might have to trailer bikes down the mountain depending if you can ride on the gravel roads.","-you're expected to leave the cabin in clean condition and all trash in bags and dishes washed.

Sit on the porch and soak up those mountain views. Relax in the hot tub and count the stars. Reconnect with your spouse as you unplug from the hustle and bustle. Rest, laugh, enjoy! 

The cabin is located on a working family farm. You can purchase beef, pork, and chicken to cook while you’re here or bring a cooler and take some home.

Take a break from life. Get away. Come relax in solitude or with your spouse. Reconnect with nature. Breathe in that fresh air. Observe wildlife and get a taste of life on the farm.

The cabin completely private, but if you’d like to visit with family or friends there is another cabin located on the farm too. Check out our other listing for Valley View Cabin. You cannot see the other cabin, but it is located a couple hundred yards away.

You will have the entire cabin to yourself. You can go for a walk, enjoy the hot tub, grill out, roast marshmallows over the fire pit, or just rock on the front porch and take it easy.

We are available by phone (call or text) if you need anything.  We can offer suggestions of things to do while here (folder of information in the cabin). If we’re around we’d be happy to show you around the farm.

We are about a mile off of Hwy 16 (Back of the Dragon). About 10 miles from Hungry Mother State Park (hiking, fishing, beach swimming area...). We’re 25 minutes from Marion where there is an adorable Main Street with shops and eateries.  We are about 45 minutes from Abingdon (Barter Theatre, antique shopping, dining, winery...).

We are not near any public transportation.

We are about 25 minutes away from town. So, you may want to plan to stop at the grocery store on your way in. There are plenty of great restaurants in Marion. (We have a list of restaurants and activities to do while here.) FYI: Many of the Marion shops/restaurants are CLOSED on Mondays!

On our farm we raise and sell pastured beef, chicken, and pork. If you plan to cook while you are here let us know and you can order some homegrown meat ahead of time and we will have it waiting in your fridge. (Sausage or bacon for breakfast, steaks, hamburger, chicken breast, pork chops...) Bring a cooler so you can take some beef, chicken, and pork back home with you. You can see what's available and order directly through our website www.oldrichvalleyfarm dot com.","Hot tubs are very expensive.  We ask that you read and follow all rules of the hot tub (listed in the cabin) to make sure it doesn’t get damaged.  

This is a working farm. We ask that you are very careful around the animals and stay off of all farm equipment.","We are available by phone (call or text) if you need anything.

Are you a railroad enthusiast? Bluefield prospered as a center for the railroad transport of coal.  Norfolk Southern still maintains an office at 800 Princeton Avenue in downtown Bluefield. The city offers many vantage points for photography, with spots where you can pull off the road and take spectacular photos as the trains rumble by. Of interest to children: The Ridgerunner train leaves on a milelong loop, from noon to 6 p.m. on weekends, from Bluefield City Park from April through September, but be careful: That train whistle is loud! For researchers and scholars, a wealth of information is tucked away in the Eastern Regional Coal Archives, which are attached to the Craft Memorial Library in Bluefield, including railroad memorabilia, maps, company records and historic photographs and documents.

Both Bluefield, West Virginia, and Bluefield, Virginia, have extensive bus service. The driveway is large enough to accommodate a trailer. 
ATV parking may be arranged off-site.

Rental of the cottage includes a souvenir fishing permit.  This will give you complete access to the fishing supplies in Ishmael's Tackle Shop.  Ishmael's is located just below the cottage- we'll have it unlocked for you.  We do require that after any photographs, you throw your fish back in the pond. (Swimming is not allowed in the pond.) (Ice skating on the pond is also not allowed.)

We are currently building a pencil museum for Jill's collection.  The pencil museum opens up to our Blackberry Boardwalk.  It's a nice walkway through the edge of the woods near the pond.  It also helps make the blackberries more accessible during season (they're typically ripe in August and you're welcome to help yourself!) Although the museum is still in a construction phase, the Blackberry Boardwalk is complete.

Also, we are located in a very popular area for ATV riders.  We are 38.8 miles to the Pocahontas Trail Head (Hatfield & McCoy ATV & UTV Trails).  You are welcome to use any tools in our garage for maintenance of your ATV or UTV while you are visiting. 

You're free to walk throughout the property, including the gardens.  Please also treat the gardens like a buffet.  You're welcome to eat all of the vegetables and fruit you want while you're here.  You're also welcome to help with any animal chores and gardening (especially fun for kids!) and we love to answer any questions you have.

When it is time for your check-out, you can just walk away!  No cleaning or locking up needed.  We like for folks to be able to completely relax and not worry about any of the details. :-)","human","Stay in the Storybook Cottage at the Holliday Castle!

The Storybook Cottage is a fairytale-inspired tiny crooked house.  The Cottage is located directly behind our house - which is in the process of being converted into a castle. Our property houses apple trees, plum trees, cherry trees, grapevines, peach trees, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, and pear trees- in addition to mass quantities of vegetables. 

In the photographs posted, you'll be able to see more about the property, the placement of the Cottage in relation to the main house, and some of the animals. :-)

In the Cottage, you'll find books, board games, and general whimsy. During the late spring and summer, the front porch opens up into an edible front yard- feel free to help yourself!  The back porch overlooks the pond (beautiful, but not suitable for skating!).  Rental of the cottage comes with access to the fishing supplies located in Ishmael's Tackle Shop.  Ishmael's is located just below the cottage- we keep it unlocked for our guests.  (However, swimming is not allowed in the pond- and when it's frozen over, no skating is allowed either.)

The Cottage is a tiny house, yet still has a lot of amenities!  You have your own private kitchenette, equipped with a sink, mini-fridge, breakfast station (which includes a coffee pot, toaster oven and griddle), a microwave and a table with seats for two.  (Due to the size of this kitchenette, we were unable to include a traditional oven with stovetop. If you have any questions about the kitchenette, please just let us know! ) This kitchenette also includes dishes (mugs, larger cups, plates, bowls and silverware)  and a folding tray for reading or enjoying your meals in bed.  During the warmer season, we provide a retro cooler for your use while fishing or picnicking.

You will also have your own private bathroom with an antique sink and claw foot tub (with shower).  We provide you with towels, washcloths, soap, shampoo, conditioner, bubble bath and a hair dryer. (If you've forgotten anything else, just let us know- we probably have extras!)

The Cottage also has, what we call, a ""mud room.""  It's a small room where you'll find a bench and a picnic basket (during season).  During the holidays, the mudroom is decked out with a Christmas tree. The mudroom is intended as a place for you to unload, store your umbrella and shed your shoes.  In the winter months, this room is also outfitted with boot warmers.  

The main room houses a queen size bed, a rocking chair, a tv (w/ dvd player), and a dresser (which converts into a lighted desk.) We also provide you with an iron and ironing board.  There is not a closet; however, there is a hook on the door for hanging your garment bag. The bedding is composed of two down alternative pillows, two ""SpaLuxury"" pillows, and two 100% cotton blankets.  There are three separate heaters located throughout the cottage. There is also a window air conditioner. The main room/bedroom overlooks the pond with an entire wall of windows (don't worry- there are room-darkening curtains if you prefer to sleep in!)  

If you would like to bring your child(ren), please send me a message beforehand.  I am sure that a small air mattress will fit beside the queen size bed (and I will prepare it for you!), but I want to share exact dimensions with you to ensure you'll be pleased with the layout of the room. Also, if you're bringing young children, please let me know!  I will ensure the cottage is stocked with some age-appropriate toys. 

Regarding breakfast, your kitchen will be stocked with a standard brew of coffee, as well as tea bags.  Upon your arrival, you will find a basket of fruit and zucchini bread (or something similar), as well as a couple bottles of water in your fridge. We have decided to leave this welcome/breakfast basket for you so as not to disturb your sleep the next morning.  During the winter months, your kitchen is also stocked with hot cocoa mix.

We currently have a dog, cats, and a chicken.  This past winter has been hard on the animals.  Pumpkin, our pet turkey passed away, as well as our duck, and one of the chickens. This spring (2023), we will be getting baby chickens, ducks and turkeys.

**Update April 2023:  We had a very bad windstorm and a handsome little rooster blew in and has fallen deeply in love with our Chicken Little.  They have moved into Pumpkin's old house and are inseparable. We realize he's an early riser and not all of us are--- so we are now providing ear plugs for each guest in the cottage (just in case.)

The entire Cottage is for your use.  

Rental of the cottage includes a souvenir fishing permit.  This will give you complete access to the fishing supplies in Ishmael's Tackle Shop.  Ishmael's is located just below the cottage- we'll have it unlocked for you.  We do require that after any photographs, you throw your fish back in the pond. (Swimming is not allowed in the pond.) (Ice skating on the pond is also not allowed.)

We are currently building a pencil museum for Jill's collection.  The pencil museum opens up to our Blackberry Boardwalk.  It's a nice walkway through the edge of the woods near the pond.  It also helps make the blackberries more accessible during season (they're typically ripe in August and you're welcome to help yourself!) Although the museum is still in a construction phase, the Blackberry Boardwalk is complete.

Also, we are located in a very popular area for ATV riders.  We are 38.8 miles to the Pocahontas Trail Head (Hatfield & McCoy ATV & UTV Trails).  You are welcome to use any tools in our garage for maintenance of your ATV or UTV while you are visiting. 

You're free to walk throughout the property, including the gardens.  Please also treat the gardens like a buffet.  You're welcome to eat all of the vegetables and fruit you want while you're here.  You're also welcome to help with any animal chores and gardening (especially fun for kids!) and we love to answer any questions you have.

When it is time for your check-out, you can just walk away!  No cleaning or locking up needed.  We like for folks to be able to completely relax and not worry about any of the details. :-)

You will see us on the property.  We have five children living here, ranging in age from seven to eighteen.  Don't worry- they will not bother you at all- but you will probably see them outside playing.  If you need anything, I am a stay-at-home mom and am easily accessible during the day.  I can frequently be found in the kitchen, our library or the greenhouse.  We dearly love to show folks around our place and answer any questions you may have about our home, gardens, animals and/or the area.

Free parking in our packed gravel circle driveway.

This is a mid-century modern-rustic cabin that has been recently updated. Please note a few things about the property’s access and safety. The cabin is completely surrounded by water (unless it’s a dry season). Access to the cabin is via a small walk bridge. Guest will have to carry their belongings about 15 yards (small cart provided) across the bridge. Though the surrounding water is pretty shallow, don't allow children to be unattended, they can drown! The upstairs bedroom access is via a spiral staircase and not elderly, handicapped or child friendly. The upstairs patio has dated hand rails and does not provide child friendly safety railing. We welcome all guests no matter age or condition, but just want our guest to know what to plan for. There is an additional fee for more than 4 people and a maximum total of 6 people allowed. Due to the unique location of the house and the fragile waste water system; please note that there is a strict 6 person limit for our property. Unless prior arrangements have been made, in writing, guest exceeding this limit will be financially responsible for the cost to have the system pumped and serviced, plus additional cleaning fees, extra person fees and any damages or fees associated with ignoring the rules of our property. Misrepresentation of actual number of guests just to avoid the extra person fee will also incur additional cleaning fees, extra person fees and any damages or fees associated with ignoring the rules of our property. Please note we have a no pet policy. All additional costs shall be billed through Airbnb and any fees they charge may apply. By checking in to our property, guests accept these rules and the responsibilities listed above. If you do not accept and wish to cancel, you may do so within the cancellation period and receive a refund.  Thanks for your understanding as we only want to be able to share and enjoy our property for many years to come.

In addition, we have the privilege of offering you the opportunity to schedule a massage during your getaway.  A local massage therapist can travel to the cabin to offer massage therapy at your convenience.

This secluded mountain lodge lets your group enjoy fishing, hiking, swimming in the pond, kayaks, and relaxation - all without leaving the property!  You'll be close to white water rafting, rock climbing and skiing in winter, but once you settle into this 80-acre estate, you won't want to leave.
Maple Fork Lodge is a wonderfully secluded property - well off the road.  With eighty acres to explore and mountaintop views that will take your breath away - it's the perfect place for relaxing with family and friends.  The decor isn't stuffy and formal - but designed to make large groups seem cozy and intimate.
*Please note that this lodge, as any true lodge, has a number of large taxidermy animals.


Within a short drive of dozens of restaurants, movie theaters and shopping, as well as activities like mini-golf, hiking the New River Gorge, and an indoor climbing wall.
The lodge comes fully stocked with sheets, towels, kitchen utensils, coffee makers, crock pot and instat pot, toilet paper, etcetera.  Just bring yourselves!

This finely-appointed, 5600-square-foot log cabin is perfect for your family reunion, rafting trip, church or corporate retreat.

Guests will be provided with contact numbers of the house manager and property manager. They are also welcome at any time to contact the owners through Airbnb.

It's a quiet, peaceful neighborhood, but you can't see much of it from the lodge, because it's set back 500 yards off the road.

Great hiking, fishing and swimming in the ponds, and exploring the mountains are all yours without leaving the property!
