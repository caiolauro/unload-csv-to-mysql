We are within short driving distance to: Marshall University, Cabell Huntington Hospital or St. Mary's, the Huntington Mall The place is small, quaint and cozy, offers a full kitchen, comfy bed, we live close to a highway so there is some traffic and our driveway is at a incline we are in a protected area which is near the city and on a bus line.  
Also, our Wi-Fi is FAST!! 
Stay with us; voted the most desired AirBnB in Huntington in 2018!

This cute small house is perfect for overnight or a few days. It is a full 4 room apartment/small house above the garage. It used to be an rental space and now it's returned as an AirBnB. You have your own little apartment-style space - it is NOT shared with anyone.

Additionally, the yard is completely fenced in for your pet, we have 2 dogs here already!  The space is entirely yours, and protected as part of the backyard of our property but with it's own personal area.

The road is sometimes busy as you pull in but we have not had any issues.

I live in the main house and we are happy to help.

The houses are not on top of each other and there's a large backyard. There is a 2 lane road out front, and the river on the other side of the guard rail. Great view but no river access.

This location is heavily car-dependent with a bus coming by 3 times daily.

We have dogs, as does the neighbor. If you are uncomfortable around dogs this may not be the AirBnB for you.  Please be careful to close the gate as you are coming and going. 
Additionally, our neighbor raises chickens, ducks, quail and a host of other animals but they are just in the neighboring yard so they shouldn't be of any concern.","Hi, thanks for booking!

Please read and agree to the these simple guidelines we request:

- If possible, send us an estimated time of arrival so we can plan for it. We just want to be available in case you need anything.

- If you are going to bring pets (we LOVE furbabies) -please, no more than 2 animals. Also, if your animal has aggression issues or another behavioural issue, advise us in advance so we can keep our own pups safe!

Absolutely no booking for anyone other than yourself. This is against airbnb policy. 
No parties and no extra guests unless pre-approved by host.

 No Smoking or vaping. No use of illegal drugs. NO 420. 

Cottage quiet time is from 10pm - 6am. For the comfort of all guests please limit kitchen use, showering (showering when arriving from a late check in or if work hours involve you getting back late is permissible just please be courteous of other guests who are sleeping) and loud noise during these hours. 

Hand wash and put always all used dishes directly after use. No dishes are allowed to remain dirty in the sink overnight. 

The cottage is environmentally friendly and I ask that you try to reuse bath towels. There are hooks for used towels in the bathroom and on the closet door of each room. 
Place used towels and washcloths that need laundered in laundry basket in hall. 

Please use vent fan in bathroom during showers to allow moisture to escape and prevent mildew buildup.

Lower level deck and lower area of the cottage are both off limits to guests. 

No overnight guests permitted. No visiting guests allowed. This can cause a safety issue with other guests since they are not registered.

The apartment has lots of charm and modern updates. It features lots of natural light, quiet neighborhood, and it's close to downtown and local parks.  There are several small businesses within walking distance. I offer a private parking lot with 24-hour surveillance. An adorable dog lives next door and offers free petting and tail wags.

Guests have the entire apartment to themselves, plus access to the shared hallway, stairwell, and parking lot.

I will provide the door code and other logistics prior to arrival.  

You won't be sharing any part of the apartment, so feel free to come and go as you please.

I live in the back apartment, which is just across the hallway, so if you need anything please let me know.

The apartment is located in a quiet neighborhood, and it's close to downtown and local parks.  There are several small businesses within walking distance.

There is a bus stop located out in front of the apartment. A short walk down the road will take you to downtown Huntington.

***Cleaning Routine***
I meticulously clean all parts of the apartment. All linens are washed in hot water with Tide sensitive skin pods and fragrance free bleach.  I wipe down all surfaces with clorox spray and then wipe the surfaces a second time to make them shiny with 409 multi spray. I vaccum the floors and use Bona cleaner since the floors are antique.

Great location for traveling healthcare professionals or anyone interested in work in the nearby towns. 
No smoking or pets allowed.

I have a no pet policy and this includes service animals because I have allergies. I take daily prescribed medicines plus monthly allergy shots. I love animals but I am the one who cleans the apartment.

Great location for traveling healthcare professionals or anyone interested in work in the nearby towns. This apartment is within 
 
5 minutes of Martin ARH Our Lady of the way Hospital
 
15 minutes of Prestonsburg Highlands ARH Regional Medical Center
 
20-25 minutes to Paintsville Paul B. Hall regional Medical Center
 
20-25 minutes to Pikeville       Medical Center

A blacktop parking area is available in front of the apartment. This area is shared with the 1st floor guest.

If your stay is during the summer you may hear the lawn mower or weed eater. 

This is a very safe place to stay. My last two bookings were traveling healthcare professionals who worked at Pikeville Medical during their stay. I have had many long term stays. There is a built in discount for stays of 28 days or longer.","Wash dishes and put back where they were.

Hi, we are Ron and Nancy Thaxton, your host,

world.

We enjoy long walks on our 17 acre estate past small rock cliffs, an old farm chicken house, the generational initial trees started by Ron's initials carved by his grandfather to now the 5th generation.  We cross a rocky creek and explore a pine tree grove on the top of the mountain. We also enjoy watching the wild life including several species of birds, deer, ground hogs, foxes, squirrels and any other animal that may wonder by. 

Our Guest are welcome to participate in our excursions, picking apples from the orchard or roasting marshmallows on an open fire. We also offer tenting, mountain biking and hunting packages.

This secluded property is nestled in a serene country setting on 40 acres, surrounded by hills, tall pines, and a pond-front view. Pure Country is a place to escape that gives all visitors the opportunity to flee from the fast-paced world. Just minutes from I-64, and the Huntington Tri-State Airport.

This spacious home offers a comfortable and relaxing stay for your vacation.

On the main level, you'll find three inviting bedrooms with cozy queen beds, ceiling fans, and flat screen TVs for your comfort and entertainment. Additionally, there are two full baths, ensuring convenience for all guests.

The upper deck, accessible from the kitchen area, provides the perfect spot to unwind and savor your morning coffee. Immerse yourself in the tranquil ambiance as you listen to the melodies of wildlife and the soothing sounds of nature.

Adjacent to the living area, you'll discover a fully equipped kitchen and dining area, complete with a microwave, dishwasher, and a convenient coffee and tea bar. We've also stocked the cookware you need to prepare delicious home-cooked meals. However, if cooking isn't part of your vacation plans, fret not! Numerous local restaurants are just a short drive away.

Relax and bond with your loved ones in the family room, where a cozy gas-burning fireplace awaits. Gather around and enjoy a movie together, with access to Wi-Fi and Dish Network for your entertainment needs.

The lower level of the house offers an additional spacious area with a well-equipped kitchen, perfect for prepping your meals before heading out to the gas grill just steps away.

Immerse yourself in the beauty of nature surrounding the property. Embark on a nature hike, find solace in a captivating book by the lake, or indulge in the tranquil activity of fishing. As dusk settles in, embrace the crackling fire and witness the enchanting sight of fireflies illuminating the night. Look up at the star-filled sky and let feelings of tranquility wash over you. Take a deep breath of the fresh country air and appreciate the wonders of our world.

We can't wait to host you and provide an unforgettable experience during your stay.

Absolutely no booking for anyone other than yourself. This is against airbnb policy. 

 No Smoking or vaping. No use of illegal drugs. NO 420. 

Cottage quiet time is from 10pm - 6am. For the comfort of all guests please limit kitchen use, showering (showering when arriving from a late check in or if work hours involve you getting back late is permissible just please be courteous of other guests who are sleeping) and loud noise during these hours. 

Hand wash and put always all used dishes directly after use. No dishes are allowed to remain dirty in the sink overnight. 

The cottage is environmentally friendly and I ask that you try to reuse bath towels. There are hooks for used towels in the bathroom and on the closet door of each room. 
Place used towels and washcloths that need laundered in laundry basket in hall. 

Please use vent fan in bathroom during showers to allow moisture to escape and prevent mildew buildup.

Lower level deck and lower area of the cottage are both off limits to guests. 

No overnight guests permitted. No visiting guests allowed. This can cause a safety issue with other guests since they are not registered.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dear guests,

Hello and welcome to our home!  We’re so happy you chose our property for your stay.  Before you settle in and get comfortable, we would like to make you aware of the House Rules in place at our rental.  Most of these are just common courtesy.                                              

Please ensure you read and fully understand the house rules at the beginning of your stay. If anything is unclear, please contact us so we can explain in further detail to avoid any misunderstandings.

Please leave the beds you have slept in unmade so that the cleaners know which sheets to change, and pile all the dirty towels in the bathtub. If a bed is unslept in, just leave it made up neatly so we don't waste time washing clean linens. 

No parties, quiet hours are 9:00PM-9:00AM
No Pets,
No Smoking, vaping, e cigs, and marajuana 
$1,000 will be charged for violating these rules.

There is a digital keypad to enter the building.
There is a complimentary parking pass required to park.

If the parking pass is not put back at your departure there will be a $200 charge for the replacement of the pass. 

If you cannot live with our rules it may be in your best interest to book elsewhere.

●	Please treat the loft with the same respect as you would your own home. We’ve put a lot of effort into making this a lovely space to be enjoyed by our guests. This property is “new” and has all-new finishes from top to bottom and we hope it stays that way. 

●	Please keep the loft clean during your stay. It’s not the cleaner's job to clean up excessive messes and chaos left behind for them to deal with. 

●	In case of any accidental damage, please notify us immediately.  We can work together on how to repair/replace whatever is necessary. 

●	Please laugh a lot and have tons of fun! Just also understand that most of the residents here in the building call this home full time, and we would appreciate you being mindful of that -  especially later at night. We have become friends with all our neighbors and expect that we won't have any issues related to tenancy here at our place. 

●	If any neighboring residents report excessive noise or unruly behavior, we may have to evict you from our property and terminate your stay! This could result in your stay being nonrefundle based on the cancelation policy.

Off street and on street public parking. On City bus routes. Uber/Lyft access. Walking distance to restaurants, shopping, entertainment and more.","human","The beautiful thing about visiting Charleston, West Virginia is that you get the vibes of the city by staying downtown and break away for a total retreat to nature by visiting trails, parks and state forest within the mountains. All in a 10 to 15 minute commute. Come back to revive yourself with a comfortable and cozy stay at the newly renovated Atlas Loft for all your modern restful needs.

2 minutes off of I-64. Our loft apartment is located a couple of blocks to CAMC General Hospital and the Clay Center. Only 4 blocks to the the Town Center Mall, Municipal Center and the Charleston Coliseum  Convention Center. So you are in the middle of EVERYTHING to do in downtown Charleston, including restaurants and entertainment, but have plenty of room to spread out or stay for an extended length of time in full comfort and space. Quiet neighborhood but outstanding location! Newly remodeled! Open floor plan for kitchen, dining and living room space. 1 bed. 1 bath. Closet space, washer and dryer.

Our loft apartment was recently remodeled top to bottom, so it has the current and most luxurious flooring and furnishings available today. Nice furniture and decorations as well, making this place comfortable and clean. The neighbors mind their own business, and it is a peaceful and quiet neighborhood, with the perfect location. Capital Street is just two blocks away, with a great night life and restaurant row. Town Center Mall is within a seven minute walk and three minute drive, as well as being close to the Charleston Coliseum Convention Center and the Municipal Auditorium. Clay Center is just one block away as well as 2 blocks to CAMC General Hospital.

You will have the entire loft apartment to yourselves. 

Off street and on street public parking. On City bus routes. Uber/Lyft access. Walking distance to restaurants, shopping, entertainment and more.

I enjoy meeting new people and also like giving them space during their stay and travel. In an emergency or urgent situation I’m also available via phone call 24/7. For normal calls I take them between 8am and 9pm respectfully. All communication will be conducted through the AirBnB platform for security and safety measures.

Beautiful historic district of downtown Charleston, WV. Restaurants, shopping, entertainment, airport and hospitals within a 5 minute to 15 minute commute.

Our building is secured by a security door and elevator that cannot be entered unless you have a key fob or code of entry. Each guest is given a key and key fob or code to enter. Most of the residents of this building are middle aged and elderly, some of them will be lifetime residents, so they will not bother you, and we expect you to do the same.

There is public parking across the street from the building at ABM Parking Services. 

If you park your vehicle in the parking lot, for added security, we recommend that you lock your vehicle manually with the inside door lock button, rather than your remote key locker.

Our location is right downtown, so there are Ubers and taxis available, as well as a bus station four blocks away. The street in front of the building, Quarrier St., is on the bus line so you can catch the bus right there. The loft is only 5 miles to the airport and a short car ride. You will have ample parking for two or more cars if needed. Plenty of public parking available 24/7. Walking distance from all downtown amenities with public transportation available at your convenience.

Feel safe with a security entrances for lobby entry door, stair case, and elevator access.","Dear guests,

Hello and welcome to our home!  We’re so happy you chose our property for your stay.  Before you settle in and get comfortable, we would like to make you aware of the House Rules in place at our rental.  Most of these are just common courtesy.                                              

Please ensure you read and fully understand the house rules at the beginning of your stay. If anything is unclear, please contact us so we can explain in further detail to avoid any misunderstandings.

Please leave the beds you have slept in unmade so that the cleaners know which sheets to change, and pile all the dirty towels in the bathtub. If a bed is unslept in, just leave it made up neatly so we don't waste time washing clean linens. 

No parties, quiet hours are 9:00PM-9:00AM
No Pets,
No Smoking, vaping, e cigs, and marajuana 
$1,000 will be charged for violating these rules.

There is a digital keypad to enter the building.
There is a complimentary parking pass required to park.

If the parking pass is not put back at your departure there will be a $200 charge for the replacement of the pass. 

If you cannot live with our rules it may be in your best interest to book elsewhere.

●	Please treat the loft with the same respect as you would your own home. We’ve put a lot of effort into making this a lovely space to be enjoyed by our guests. This property is “new” and has all-new finishes from top to bottom and we hope it stays that way. 

●	Please keep the loft clean during your stay. It’s not the cleaner's job to clean up excessive messes and chaos left behind for them to deal with. 

●	In case of any accidental damage, please notify us immediately.  We can work together on how to repair/replace whatever is necessary. 

●	Please laugh a lot and have tons of fun! Just also understand that most of the residents here in the building call this home full time, and we would appreciate you being mindful of that -  especially later at night. We have become friends with all our neighbors and expect that we won't have any issues related to tenancy here at our place. 

●	If any neighboring residents report excessive noise or unruly behavior, we may have to evict you from our property and terminate your stay! This could result in your stay being nonrefundle based on the cancelation policy.

●	In the unlikely case of any disputes or neighbor complaints, it is your duty to notify us as soon as reasonably possible.

●	We try to keep our vacation rental as child-friendly as possible. That said, parents always have the final responsibility of ensuring their children’s safety at all times. If you find anything to be unsafe or that requires revision at our property, please contact us at your earliest convenience so we can address the issue. 

●	To maintain our property kid-friendly, we ask that you:
o	Never leave children unsupervised at our property without any adults.
o	Never let children play on out in the street unattended
o	Parents must not leave children unattended at any time. Any guest injuries sustained inside OR outside the house/apartment are not covered by our vacation rental insurance.

●	Please do not overload or underload the washer.  

●	Please make sure you switch off lights, fans or any other small electrical appliances when you go out. 

●	In the unlikely case of a power outage, please call us before touching the control panel.

●	No compensation will be given for any temporary outage of electricity, gas, water, cable, satellite or telephone service.

While we have taken the necessary measures to make our rental safe for incoming guests, you also have a role to play in ensuring the safety and security of your party. There are actions you can follow to keep the loft apartment secure during your stay.

●	Any time guests leave the rental, it is their responsibility to ensure all windows and doors are closed and locked to maintain security of the loft and prevent rain and water damage.

●	We are not responsible for the loss of any personal belongings or valuables. In case you misplace something in the loft, please let us know so we can look out for the item during the next cleaning. 

●	There is a trash dumpster directly across the street from the main enttance of the building (it is blue). If staying for a long period of time and you have excessive trash that needs disposed, please use this dumpster for disposal. Do not pile trash in the loft, hallway, or lobby area.","I enjoy meeting new people and also like giving them space during their stay and travel.

Our guest house is very private, quiet, cozy, secure and exceptionally clean.   A great couples retreat with 2+miles of hiking trails and a vast space for outdoor activities and wildlife viewing. 
   The beds are comfortable and the heat and air conditioning are great.  We have all the amenities...all linens and beddings are furnished.  There is a washer, dryer, iron and hair dryer and detergent.
We are nestled on over 100 acres of land and are 1000 feet from the nearest highway.

A clean and cozy guesthouse with nice touches of hardwood and hard surfaces. 
  One bedroom has a queen bed and the other has a bunkbed and both include bedding and extra blankets.
  There is a living room with a 4k smart TV, LAN line,  wifi router, Fast internet (119 mbps), and Roku.
  A wooden deck provides a great place to sit outside and relax and entertain.
Very private, safe, and secure.  Absolutely no animals or pets  allowed.

You will have access to the guesthouse and some hiking trails on the property.

I enjoy talking to to the guest but understand the  importance of letting the guest have their space.  I can be contacted by text, phone, or in person.

Our place is only 6 minutes from Cabell Huntington  Hospital and 10 minutes to Marahall University.  We are located just 1.5 miles south of interstate 64 at exit 11 with the comforts of a rural country setting and the convenience of being close to town.  The space is cozy and private.  The property offers hiking trails and wildlife viewing for those wanting to get out in nature.

You'll be best traveling via car in the the Huntington area and a 4 wheel drive when the roads get snowy.

NO ANIMALS- NO SMOKING OR VAPING INSIDE-NO PARTIES-NO DRUGS.  
This is a new listing and it's a new venture for me and my family.    I concider it to be a exceptionally clean place with plenty of privacy and easy access to the interstate and downtown Huntington.","No pets.

he might enjoy listing one of his furnished apartments for short-term rental. The two of them had so much fun setting up the space for travelers that he has kept it going. Bill loves traveling and has been to various points around the USA, but nothing compares to his time spent in Uganda, East Africa (though he still claims West Virginia beats all!).

We love to meet each of our guests but also realize that’s not always feasible. Our interaction can be as much or as little as our guests would like. We are a busy family so we are often not around in evenings. We offer self check in for all guests but are happy to show you to the room personally if you’d like! If you prefer your privacy, that’s fine by us! We love to recommend restaurants and other activities for guests to try in our small town...so please ask!

Riverlike Estates is a fairly large, quiet neighborhood located a few miles outside of Saint Albans, WV. It is perfect for walking, jogging, or cycling. Neighbors are very friendly! In the middle of the neighborhood is a lake where you may fish, as well as basketball court and play grounds. Secluded neighborhood gives a serene feel to the space.
Though it is a few miles from town it is still convenient to essential amenities. A Dollar General store and Par Mar Convenience store/gas station are both located within walking distance and other essentials (coffee shop, restaurants, post office, library, banks, laundry mat, grocery stores, etc) are only a couple minute (3-5 minute) drive back to town.

This space is located several miles from the nearest bus station and buses do not run to our neighborhood. Uber and Lyft (as well as local taxi service) are available if you do not have transportation of your own. Parking for your vehicle is provided in our driveway.

Please be aware that we do have children and pets. They will not be in your space, but you will definitely see ""signs of life"". Our Labradoodle Barnabas and his sidekick Goldendoodle Finn might greet you with a bark, and you'll see our children (or their toys) playing in the yard frequently. 

Check out time is no later than 10:00am. If you'd like a later check out you must let us know 48 hours prior to your arrival. A $10 fee will be assessed for later check out. Late check out will be granted based on availability. 

Check in time is 4:00pm or later. If you'd like earlier check-in you must let us know 48 hours prior to your arrival. A $10 fee will be assessed for early check-in. Early check in will only be granted based on availability. 

As listed in the amenities section, we have a TV in the space but no cable. Some guests choose to bring their own streaming device (FireStick, AppleTV, etc) or just use the DVD player we have available. 

Coffee is provided in room for your convenience as well as a few snacks and cold breakfast items (breakfast bars or oatmeal)

There is a mini fridge, electric kettle and microwave in the room for your use. 
 
We do have children in our home and while we attempt to keep the noise levels to a minimum, please know that it is likely that you will hear us throughout your stay.

Upgrade notes: 

6/2022 - Wifi-6 internet router.  High speeds of 340mbps to 700mbps on wifi.  Wide range of coverage in house. 

5/30/2021 - upgraded spa heater to a 104-102F temp spread and new 4.4KV element 240v with a solid state thermo control that isn’t affected by mining power spikes and controlled on a commercial 4 wire 50a GFCI breaker.  

5/30/2021 WIFI Speedtest - 5g WiFi Speedtest on LGv60 phone registered 237.0 down / 51.8 up with ping 11ms, jitter of 2ms and 0.0% loss.  3 bars signal on t-Mobil, but we recommend using wifi-calling at the house.   My iPadpro Gen3 is 338.0 down and 52.4 up on the 5g network. 

6/20/2020 - upgraded Gigabyte internet service into house with 350/50 WIFI on 5G WIFI channels.  10x increased speed over the better service in our tri-county area.  Feed to house is 1 gig, but device levels on wifi are ranging 220-350d.  Its fast. 

Covid control notice:  to ensure a sanitized air environment for our guests and property personnel, we have installed dual zone RGF REME and Air Guardian units.  We are the first and only known location in the state of WV at this time having this level of air purification with these quality USA made devices.  We have used it for years but this year we increased to dual-zone. We are also committed to proper cleaning and laundering, but this additional REME step puts our location in a class of its own for respiratory health and protection.  We are already located in an area having exceptionally low case counts.  More than socially distance yourself in West Virginia - the mountains that surround us became our protection.   In our opinion, the mature hardwood trees on steep mountain sides create dense levels of fresh oxygen that cannot exist in flat city landscapes, if think about it. 

Statement from RGF:   The Guardian Air QR+ utilizes RGF’s patented PHI-Cell® technology and is easily mounted onto your existing air conditioning and heating system air ducts. When the HVAC system is in operation, the Guardian QR+ creates an advanced oxidation plasma (AOP) that is distributed through the duct system into the conditioning living space. Unlike passive air technologies, which need pollutants to pass through the unit for purification or filtration, the Guardian QR+ sweeps through our home actively purifying pollutants at the source. The advanced oxidation plasma consists of hydro-peroxides, oxide ions and hydroxide ions. All are friendly oxidizers that are found in nature’s process of cleaning the outdoor air and are safe for humans and animals alike.

The Guardian QR+ is an air purifier.   It does not reduce particulate matter like dust - but the AC deep pleat filters do. We have added a REME HALO for air purifier with added particulate reduction and that is even more effective at removing these allergens. 

REME HALO 
 Dual ionizers to reduce airborne particulates (dust, dander, pollen, mold spores)
• Kills up to 99% of bacteria, mold and viruses
• REME® reduces sneeze germs by 99% in the time a sneeze can reach three feet.
• New zinc ions kill 99% of viruses on surfaces
• Unlike portable units that are limited to the room in which they are placed, the REME HALO® provides whole home and building purification.
• Easily integrated with your existing HVAC system. The unit doesn’t take away living space and operates silently.
• Incorporates an adjustable REME® cell, which allows customization of the advanced oxidation plasma output.

We have ran these units at Chapmanville for 3 years now and for an additional 8 years in other residences of our and our family members.  

further RGF info: 
U.S. Military approved for mold reduction in field hospitals.
• U.S. and International Hospital approval for the fight against infectious diseases: 99% reduction of Staph (MRSA).
• Major U.S. city school test reports 20% reduction in absenteeism.
• Tested and approved by Asian Government for protection against the deadly SARS virus.
• Approved by the USDA, FSIS, and FDA for use in food processing plants. Employed to reduce microbial contamination of food being processed.
• Cruise lines use it as a safety measure against Norwalk Virus outbreaks.

The REME HALO® is installed in a wide variety of residential, commercial and industrial applications where a ducted HVAC system exists. Here are some examples:
• Single family homes, apartments, condos
• In hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and doctor’s offices
• Schools, daycare centers, colleges and universities
• Fitness centers, locker rooms, athletic facilities
• Office buildings
• Veterinary clinics, animal hospitals, kennels,
• Hotels, motels, and resorts.
• Food processing and manufacturing plants/facilities
• Restaurants, diners, and bars

We utilize two Wifi heat pump thermostats to maintain a set temperature range for the two systems.  It is remotely managed.  The fall/winter heat pump default is 70Heat-73AC.  If you run colder in the winter let us know and we can adjust it down to 68Heat-72AC a day before check in.  We also leave a out dehumidifier out downstairs (please help by emptying into downstairs sink or bathtub) to keep humidity down lower, its easy and takes 1 minute.

Please note - in general we dont accept guests with 0 reviews or unverified status.  For those new to airbnb, all guests must submit a valid photo ID along with full name and reply to this request with clear photos send  inside the Airbnb app within 24 hours of booking.  The guest count must reflect the number of ID’s submitted.  Non-response to this request will result in cancellation and refund of fees per airbnb policy.  Our property manager will verify guests and ID the day of arrival.

The property manager is nearby and accessible.  We also have a 2-way-talk/video RING doorbell on the front porch to contact our cellphones directly 24 hours a day.  The area has good Wifi coverage of 5g and 2.4g with AC/MIMO.  Wifi password is available on request for guests and provided in the guest document after the reservation is complete.

The neighborhood is rural-country.   We are on a hill above a nice flat.   Its a big home that can hold a large family or group of friends.  

The area is very pretty and also WV upscale.  Although it is rural, its still about 30min to s. charleston and about 15 min to super=big box stores that have expanded to our county.  highway 119 that connects us to town is a nice, well kept divided 4 lane highway.  We do have former governors on the street that retired to the area because of its charm and privacy.   Its one of the best kept secrets of WV.

In WV coalfield counties (Logan, Mingo, Boone,Lincoln...) you can drive on ATV or UTV marked streets legally to and from trailheads and into small towns (provided you have a valid HMT sticker on your helmet and you obey traffic laws).  You cannot drive a non-plated ATV/UTV on a divided 4-lane highway like RT 119 or the new interstate 4 lane section of rt 10 from logan to man (okay to safely cross it, just dont drive down the highway like cars do).  The old Rt10 is still there and that is ATV okay.  Many towns in SW West Virginia ( AKA the Devil's Den) are offroad-friendly - driving is a privilege, not a right - so be respectful.  Bring a Harley AND your UTV -- because our blacktop road are just as fun as our offroad trails.  Tow your Harley here with your JEEP and have the best of both worlds.  If you are riding from town to a trailhead on the backroads or into town - make CERTAIN you have a valid HMT decal on the helmet left side and your matching drivers license.   Many local gas stations sell the HMT annual permit stickers (eg. Lil Gen/Burger King @ 100 Old Co 3/3 Rd, Chapmanville, WV 25508) and there are also a few welcome centers on 119 always having stickers available.  Active Military ID from any state will get you the HMT in-state rates at the welcome center!   Also remember WV is a helmet-required state when riding on the road !

We recommend downloading a good GPS App with Topo on your phone.  Note that since “location” GPS is turned on inside your phone this consumes battery at a faster rate - so USB power batteries are a wise investment.  The apps and maps you download are not small files, so download them first on wifi and you might need to clear off or expand SD memory cards.   Sample apps:  I hike gps: topo,  maps 3D pro,  GPS tracks.   We have good wifi at the house to download these files/apps.  You probably wont have LTE cellular on the trail, so download them at home or at the 5G tower base at the Chapmanville Rt10 exit.  

G00gle maps and apple’s maps have topographical (topo) features but they dont record your trail like a GPS tracker app.  Both maps would need to be downloaded before your journey..

Country Roads Byways Visitors Center and Jeep Trailhead / Chapmanville /  12 minutes on i-119  Or 8 miles on backroads without using a trailer from the house.  This HMT trailhead allows Jeeps/RangeRovers in addition to UTV/ATV/MX.  It’s near logan/chapmanville superwalmart.  It has over 100 miles of mountain Green and Blue trails that can be navigated with a stock Jeep wrangler unlimited, weather permitting over a long weekend.  It has another 50 miles of black-dot expert trails require external cage structure installed on the Jeep.   They are serious rock-crawling level trails that are best with an extra  person navigating and often marking outside the truck, front/rear winch, lift & articulation kits. Expect body dents and severe levels of drive-train stress on black dot Jeep trails.  You may get a few paint scratches on far ends of blue dot trails, but green trails only need 4wd locked out in a few sections or if its really wet.  WV trails are very steep and drain off quickly.  The day after rain has firm soil with ideal conditions.  During rain is challenging and slick.  A run with snow is also ideal, due to the beauty of the mountains !!!

Rural WV Communication:  when at the house, plan to coordinate contacting your away crew over our WiFi connection with apps like: Whats App, Text, e-Mail, WiFi-Calling, VOIP,  Messenger, GoogleVoice...   Although we have steady high speed WiFi inside the house and around it, expect that cellular service is weak when your more than a mile off 119.  There is a powerful cell tower 2 miles away (i-119 in chapmanville), but most use our home wifi to connect.   5G cellular on the T-mobile network was installed 3/2020 on a mountain tower between our road and downtown Chapmanville.  We are on the edge of the signal - some phones pick up, others wont.   We do have gigabyte level service inside the house that is available for guest use on our dual bands 5G and 2.4G WiFi networks.

Nearest connected HMT system:  Rockhouse - Devil Anse - Buffalo Mountain:  24 miles to the main trailer lot at Man, WV with many gas/food/parts store options on the way. That’s the fastest way.  Or you can legally ride backroad 10 mi to two bear wallow connectors from house, BW to main BW lot, 17 to hanging rock road and the LYBURN rockhouse connector - leaving the trailer at this house/no trailering.  

For advanced riders with drivers license, HMT pass sticker, and proper safety gear and knowledge of WV road laws there is a Bear-wallow neighborhood connector 9 miles away that guests have ridden to without trailers on RT 10 without issues.  As always, ensure you are properly insured, sober and safe driving on any road - on holidays some areas have rolling sobriety checkpoints checking every vehicle.  Logan county is one of the southern WV counties that allow ATV operation on non-interstate roads for certain distances.  Many of the small towns are also ATV friendly.  Contact the WV state police to obtain more details and insurance requirements for your ATV operation on side roads.  Both the downtown Chapmanville connector and The  Peach-creek connector in West Logan are now within a 10 mile riding range using back-roads.        

We have backroad access (11-14 min) to nearby neighborhood connectors for Bear Wallow.  From the the Bear Wallow main lot you can take backroads now to Rockhouse - and from there to KY if you have the daylight to make it back.  search for trails heaven maps on the internet for more info. 

Also, we have backroad access to the Chapmanville Rt3 connector for bear wallow.  Its about 6 miles of scenic backroads on ATV, no trailering.  That’s the fastest way to access HMT and from there you can also connect through 2-3 other systems all the way to Kentucky.  Its a lot of riding.  

Trailer-only with no trail-to-trail connections for systems at Country Roads, and Warrior.   Country Roads is the nearest pass store @ 12 miles/12 min and the main trailer lot for Bear Wallow is 4 miles past that.  Check current covid regs in effect.  There is also a local gas station even closer with hours from 5am to midnight to buy the helmet  sticker pass.  that we can usually arrange with that gas station manager to hold and keep stickers on hand for our guests, upon an advance request. 

Pocahantas - Pinnacle Creek -  Indian Ridge:  these systems were re-opened 2/19 but see the HMT website for current status.  worth a drive, beautiful area of the state. The nearest connector @ Pineville, WV is 59 miles.


We tried to not have this statement, but one person can ruin it for many others.  Fee for burning out spa heater element is $400 plus a downtime spa fee of $30/night for following rentals until a spa tech is available to repair.  Most people cherish the spa, so please follow our suggestions of proper care for the next person.   Shower before use, no oils/lotions in spa - they clog filter and ground out heater, keep water level high, cover when not in use, no drinks in the spa, please limit to 30 minutes power-jets use each hour.  Proper use does  harm the heater.  The renter is responsible for all persons in their group.   Weve only had one instance of inconsiderate damage, and this is not an issue for most of the time but it needs to be stated so every party is considerate to the next group.  We hoped we didnt need to add this clause.","No pets/animals allowed.  No smoking, No Vaping.  First and last names of all guests must be included in reservation request for insurance reasons.

Both the downtown Chapmanville connector and The  Peach-creek connector in West Logan are now within a 10 mile riding range using back-roads.        

We have backroad access (11-14 min) to nearby neighborhood connectors for Bear Wallow.  From the the Bear Wallow main lot you can take backroads now to Rockhouse - and from there to KY if you have the daylight to make it back.  search for trails heaven maps on the internet for more info. 

Also, we have backroad access to the Chapmanville Rt3 connector for bear wallow.  Its about 6 miles of scenic backroads on ATV, no trailering.  That’s the fastest way to access HMT and from there you can also connect through 2-3 other systems all the way to Kentucky.  Its a lot of riding.  

Trailer-only with no trail-to-trail connections for systems at Country Roads, and Warrior.   Country Roads is the nearest pass store @ 12 miles/12 min and the main trailer lot for Bear Wallow is 4 miles past that.  Check current covid regs in effect.  There is also a local gas station even closer with hours from 5am to midnight to buy the helmet  sticker pass.  that we can usually arrange with that gas station manager to hold and keep stickers on hand for our guests, upon an advance request. 

Pocahantas - Pinnacle Creek -  Indian Ridge:  these systems were re-opened 2/19 but see the HMT website for current status.  worth a drive, beautiful area of the state. The nearest connector @ Pineville, WV is 59 miles.


We tried to not have this statement, but one person can ruin it for many others.  Fee for burning out spa heater element is $400 plus a downtime spa fee of $30/night for following rentals until a spa tech is available to repair.  Most people cherish the spa, so please follow our suggestions of proper care for the next person.   Shower before use, no oils/lotions in spa - they clog filter and ground out heater, keep water level high, cover when not in use, no drinks in the spa, please limit to 30 minutes power-jets use each hour.  Proper use does  harm the heater.  The renter is responsible for all persons in their group.   Weve only had one instance of inconsiderate damage, and this is not an issue for most of the time but it needs to be stated so every party is considerate to the next group.  We hoped we didnt need to add this clause.","House:

Covid control notice:  to ensure a sanitized air environment for our guests and property personnel, we have installed dual zone RGF REME and Air Guardian units.  We are the first and only known location in the state of WV at this time having this level of air purification with these quality USA made devices.  We have used it for years but this year we increased to dual-zone. We are also committed to proper cleaning and laundering, but this additional REME step puts our location in a class of its own for respiratory health and protection.  We are already located in an area having exceptionally low case counts.  More than socially distance yourself in West Virginia - the mountains that surround us became our protection.   In our opinion, the mature hardwood trees on steep mountain sides create dense levels of fresh oxygen that cannot exist in flat city landscapes, if think about it. 

Statement from RGF:   The Guardian Air QR+ utilizes RGF’s patented PHI-Cell® technology and is easily mounted onto your existing air conditioning and heating system air ducts. When the HVAC system is in operation, the Guardian QR+ creates an advanced oxidation plasma (AOP) that is distributed through the duct system into the conditioning living space. Unlike passive air technologies, which need pollutants to pass through the unit for purification or filtration, the Guardian QR+ sweeps through our home actively purifying pollutants at the source. The advanced oxidation plasma consists of hydro-peroxides, oxide ions and hydroxide ions. All are friendly oxidizers that are found in nature’s process of cleaning the outdoor air and are safe for humans and animals alike.

The Guardian QR+ is an air purifier.   It does not reduce particulate matter like dust - but the AC deep pleat filters do. We have added a REME HALO for air purifier with added particulate reduction and that is even more effective at removing these allergens. 

REME HALO 
 Dual ionizers to reduce airborne particulates (dust, dander, pollen, mold spores)
• Kills up to 99% of bacteria, mold and viruses
• REME® reduces sneeze germs by 99% in the time a sneeze can reach three feet.
• New zinc ions kill 99% of viruses on surfaces
• Unlike portable units that are limited to the room in which they are placed, the REME HALO® provides whole home and building purification.
• Easily integrated with your existing HVAC system. The unit doesn’t take away living space and operates silently.
• Incorporates an adjustable REME® cell, which allows customization of the advanced oxidation plasma output.

We have ran these units at Chapmanville for 3 years now and for an additional 8 years in other residences of our and our family members.  

further RGF info: 
U.S. Military approved for mold reduction in field hospitals.
• U.S. and International Hospital approval for the fight against infectious diseases: 99% reduction of Staph (MRSA).
• Major U.S. city school test reports 20% reduction in absenteeism.
• Tested and approved by Asian Government for protection against the deadly SARS virus.
• Approved by the USDA, FSIS, and FDA for use in food processing plants. Employed to reduce microbial contamination of food being processed.
• Cruise lines use it as a safety measure against Norwalk Virus outbreaks.

The REME HALO® is installed in a wide variety of residential, commercial and industrial applications where a ducted HVAC system exists. Here are some examples:
• Single family homes, apartments, condos
• In hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and doctor’s offices
• Schools, daycare centers, colleges and universities
• Fitness centers, locker rooms, athletic facilities
• Office buildings
• Veterinary clinics, animal hospitals, kennels,
• Hotels, motels, and resorts.
• Food processing and manufacturing plants/facilities
• Restaurants, diners, and bars

We utilize two Wifi heat pump thermostats to maintain a set temperature range for the two systems.  It is remotely managed.  The fall/winter heat pump default is 70Heat-73AC.  If you run colder in the winter let us know and we can adjust it down to 68Heat-72AC a day before check in.  We also leave a out dehumidifier out downstairs (please help by emptying into downstairs sink or bathtub) to keep humidity down lower, its easy and takes 1 minute.

Please note - in general we dont accept guests with 0 reviews or unverified status.  For those new to airbnb, all guests must submit a valid photo ID along with full name and reply to this request with clear photos send  inside the Airbnb app within 24 hours of booking.  The guest count must reflect the number of ID’s submitted.  Non-response to this request will result in cancellation and refund of fees per airbnb policy.  Our property manager will verify guests and ID the day of arrival.","Relax on our 3500sqft 5 bedroom/3bath country estate on acreage.

Private off-street parking, security lights.  3  minutes from highway 119 in scenic and historic Chapmanville, WV.","In WV coalfield counties (Logan, Mingo, Boone,Lincoln...) you can drive on ATV or UTV marked streets legally to and from trailheads and into small towns (provided you have a valid HMT sticker on your helmet and you obey traffic laws).  You cannot drive a non-plated ATV/UTV on a divided 4-lane highway like RT 119 or the new interstate 4 lane section of rt 10 from logan to man (okay to safely cross it, just dont drive down the highway like cars do).  The old Rt10 is still there and that is ATV okay.  Many towns in SW West Virginia ( AKA the Devil's Den) are offroad-friendly - driving is a privilege, not a right - so be respectful.  Bring a Harley AND your UTV -- because our blacktop road are just as fun as our offroad trails.  Tow your Harley here with your JEEP and have the best of both worlds.  If you are riding from town to a trailhead on the backroads or into town - make CERTAIN you have a valid HMT decal on the helmet left side and your matching drivers license.   Many local gas stations sell the HMT annual permit stickers (eg. Lil Gen/Burger King @ 100 Old Co 3/3 Rd, Chapmanville, WV 25508) and there are also a few welcome centers on 119 always having stickers available.  Active Military ID from any state will get you the HMT in-state rates at the welcome center!   Also remember WV is a helmet-required state when riding on the road !

We recommend downloading a good GPS App with Topo on your phone.  Note that since “location” GPS is turned on inside your phone this consumes battery at a faster rate - so USB power batteries are a wise investment.  The apps and maps you download are not small files, so download them first on wifi and you might need to clear off or expand SD memory cards.   Sample apps:  I hike gps: topo,  maps 3D pro,  GPS tracks.   We have good wifi at the house to download these files/apps.  You probably wont have LTE cellular on the trail, so download them at home or at the 5G tower base at the Chapmanville Rt10 exit.  

G00gle maps and apple’s maps have topographical (topo) features but they dont record your trail like a GPS tracker app.  Both maps would need to be downloaded before your journey..

Country Roads Byways Visitors Center and Jeep Trailhead / Chapmanville /  12 minutes on i-119  Or 8 miles on backroads without using a trailer from the house.  This HMT trailhead allows Jeeps/RangeRovers in addition to UTV/ATV/MX.  It’s near logan/chapmanville superwalmart.  It has over 100 miles of mountain Green and Blue trails that can be navigated with a stock Jeep wrangler unlimited, weather permitting over a long weekend.  It has another 50 miles of black-dot expert trails require external cage structure installed on the Jeep.   They are serious rock-crawling level trails that are best with an extra  person navigating and often marking outside the truck, front/rear winch, lift & articulation kits. Expect body dents and severe levels of drive-train stress on black dot Jeep trails.  You may get a few paint scratches on far ends of blue dot trails, but green trails only need 4wd locked out in a few sections or if its really wet.  WV trails are very steep and drain off quickly.  The day after rain has firm soil with ideal conditions.  During rain is challenging and slick.  A run with snow is also ideal, due to the beauty of the mountains !!!","41","45","61","77","665",,,,"pdp_m2_5_bathroom","","Bathroom","40","44","46","73","85","86","671",,,,,"pdp_m2_5_bedroom_laundry","","Bedroom and laundry","1",,,,,"pdp_m2_5_entertainment","","Entertainment","392",,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_family","","Family","5","30","139",,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_heating_cooling","","Heating and cooling","35","36","37","39",,,,,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_home_safety","","Home safety","4","47",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_internet_office","","Internet and office","8","89","90","91","92","93","94","95","96","145","236","251","308","625","626","672",,"pdp_m2_5_kitchen_dining","","Kitchen and dining","57","132","663",,,,"pdp_m2_5_location","","Location features","99","100","101","179","280",,"pdp_m2_5_outdoor","","Outdoor","9","23","25",,"pdp_m2_5_parking_facilities","","Parking and facilities","53","104",,,"pdp_m2_5_services","","Services","33","34",,,"pdp_unavailable","","Not included","false","4.79","WV","0","https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/27570697"

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. No parties or events may be held at the Loft or on the property. 
2. No overnight guests other than those registered and approved when making the reservation online. If you are expecting visitors for a short period of time during your stay, please let your hosts know.
3. No pets are permitted without prior permission and with an additional pet charge of $25 per pet (maximum one large dog or two small dogs). Sorry, no cats are permitted ever. We have four (friendly) dogs so we will need to coordinate yard usage to avoid any possible problems. Please clean up after your pet! Pets may not be left unattended for more than 2 hours and must be in a kennel/travel carrier. If you need assistance finding a dog-sitter please contact your hosts ahead of time.
4. Trash cans and bags are provided in the Loft (under the sink in the kitchen and bathroom). If the cans get full during your stay, please take the trash out and put in one of the trash cans in, or by, the driveway. No need to take out the trash at the end of your stay.
5. No hair dying or coloring is permitted in the Loft.
6. We do not have child safety features; children are welcome if you accept liability and are comfortable knowing we have no child proofing along with many stairs.
7. Minors under the age of 18 must be accompanied, in person AT ALL TIMES, by an adult over 21. You must be 21 to book a reservation at the Loft.
8. The antler hooks by the door will not hold heavy loads. Please only hang light jackets and clothing on them.
9. Please clean your boots/shoes as well as you can before entering the building and use the boot tray upstairs by the door for your boots and shoes.
10. Please do not block neighbor’s driveways, including the apartment’s next door. We will do what we can to help you with parking (including our driveway and street parking in front of our house). Please let us know if you’re traveling with a trailer so we can help you plan for parking.
11. If you would like to sit outside, you are welcome to use the camp chairs at the bottom of the stairs. If it is raining or too sunny, feel free to sit under the carport by the house. If we are parked there, just send us a message during daytime hours (9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) and we’ll move our car: we want you to enjoy your stay! You can also sit in the backyard but be aware that our dogs will occasionally need to be let out. If you are using the yard and/or grill, we will check with you before letting out the dogs. When sitting outside after 9 p.m. please try to keep the noise down so as not to disturb the residents and neighbors.
12. Do not go out on the roof. While it looks like a great place to hang out, it’s not safe for people and walking on the shingles are likely to cause damage.
13. Without exception, no smoking, vaping or marijuana usage inside the Loft. Please don’t think it can be covered up, it cannot. We have to extensively clean to remove the contaminant before other guests can arrive. Neutralizing this contaminant inside requires a $100 minimum service fee. Feel free to step outside in the back yard and quietly enjoy a tobacco smoke or vape; you'll just need to police your butts.
14. Before you leave, please wash any dishes that you used. Clean dishes can be left in the drainer to dry and we’ll put them away.
15. No need to strip the bed or pile up used towels and washcloths upon departure but during your stay, please hang wet towels and washcloths on the towel racks, shower curtain rod or side of the bathtub.
16. Please lock the door at the bottom of the steps whenever you leave the premises, including your departure.

At over 50 years old, the Loft shows its age with multiple layers of paint and years of cosmetic repairs, but it has been recently renovated to create a safe, clean & comfortable space.

You can use our Adirondack chairs to spend time outside or stay in and watch your streaming apps on the Roku TV. There isn't a stove or oven in the Loft but there is a microwave, coffee maker, hot water kettle, toaster, air fryer and electric skillet for simple food preparation, and a grill in the garage you can use upon request.  There are also many great restaurants in Logan just a few minutes away.

If we are parked there, just send us a message during daytime hours (9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) and we’ll move our car: we want you to enjoy your stay! You can also sit in the backyard but be aware that our dogs will occasionally need to be let out. If you are using the yard and/or grill, we will check with you before letting out the dogs. When sitting outside after 9 p.m. please try to keep the noise down so as not to disturb the residents and neighbors.
12. Do not go out on the roof. While it looks like a great place to hang out, it’s not safe for people and walking on the shingles are likely to cause damage.
13. Without exception, no smoking, vaping or marijuana usage inside the Loft. Please don’t think it can be covered up, it cannot. We have to extensively clean to remove the contaminant before other guests can arrive. Neutralizing this contaminant inside requires a $100 minimum service fee. Feel free to step outside in the back yard and quietly enjoy a tobacco smoke or vape; you'll just need to police your butts.
14. Before you leave, please wash any dishes that you used. Clean dishes can be left in the drainer to dry and we’ll put them away.
15. No need to strip the bed or pile up used towels and washcloths upon departure but during your stay, please hang wet towels and washcloths on the towel racks, shower curtain rod or side of the bathtub.
16. Please lock the door at the bottom of the steps whenever you leave the premises, including your departure.","We're available during your stay for assistance or to answer questions but you'll have as much privacy as you're looking for.","en","English","Foggy Mountain Loft near Hatfield & McCoy Trails","There are many places to eat in Logan and a lot of things to do:

You can use our Adirondack chairs to spend time outside or stay in and watch your streaming apps on the Roku TV.

There are also many great restaurants in Logan just a few minutes away.","Great place near Hatfield & McCoy trailheads! The Foggy Mountain Loft has the feel of a mountain hideaway but in town, close to where you want to play & eat. There's a private entrance to this simple guest loft above the garage behind our home. You'll find a basic kitchenette, full bathroom, Roku TV and WiFi. At over 50 years old, the Loft shows its age with multiple layers of paint and years of cosmetic repairs, but it has been recently renovated to create a safe, clean & comfortable space.","On street parking is easy to find near Foggy Mountain Loft. If you're raveling with a trailer you'll be able to find a spot within a couple blocks of the Loft. With prior arrangement, guests traveling with a trailer can have the parking spaces in front of  our house saved by us until their arrival or can park in the driveway (pulling truck into carport, there's room for a trailer with one ATV).","41","45","61","77","79","657","665",,"pdp_m2_5_bathroom","","Bathroom","40","73","85","86",,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_bedroom_laundry","","Bedroom and laundry","1",,,,,"pdp_m2_5_entertainment","","Entertainment","392",,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_family","","Family","5","30","139",,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_heating_cooling","","Heating and cooling","35","36","39",,,,,,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_home_safety","","Home safety","4","47",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_internet_office","","Internet and office","8","89","90","91","93","94","137","146","236","251","308","476","626",,,,,"pdp_m2_5_kitchen_dining","","Kitchen and dining","57","663",,,,,"pdp_m2_5_location","","Location features","99","101","280",,,,"pdp_m2_5_outdoor","","Outdoor","9","23",,,"pdp_m2_5_parking_facilities","","Parking and facilities","53","103","104",,"pdp_m2_5_services","","Services","33","34",,,"pdp_unavailable","","Not included","false","4.95","WV","0","https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/47385627"
