Absolutely no booking for anyone other than yourself. This is against airbnb policy. 

 No Smoking or vaping. No use of illegal drugs. NO 420. 

Cottage quiet time is from 10pm - 6am. For the comfort of all guests please limit kitchen use, showering (showering when arriving from a late check in or if work hours involve you getting back late is permissible just please be courteous of other guests who are sleeping) and loud noise during these hours. 

Hand wash and put always all used dishes directly after use. No dishes are allowed to remain dirty in the sink overnight. 

The cottage is environmentally friendly and I ask that you try to reuse bath towels. There are hooks for used towels in the bathroom and on the closet door of each room. 
Place used towels and washcloths that need laundered in laundry basket in hall. 

Please use vent fan in bathroom during showers to allow moisture to escape and prevent mildew buildup.

Lower level deck and lower area of the cottage are both off limits to guests. 

No overnight guests permitted. No visiting guests allowed. This can cause a safety issue with other guests since they are not registered.

Huntington has always been my home and I enjoy meeting folks from other places.
I enjoy backpacking, wildlife, fishing, riding mountain bikes, and mostly hiking long distances in the mountains. 
Airbnb is a new venture for me and I love making things nice for the guests and treating them like I like to be treated.  The reviews are a cool reward.☺☺☺

Our guest house is very private, quiet, cozy, secure and exceptionally clean.   A great couples retreat with 2+miles of hiking trails and a vast space for outdoor activities and wildlife viewing. 
   The beds are comfortable and the heat and air conditioning are great.  We have all the amenities...all linens and beddings are furnished.  There is a washer, dryer, iron and hair dryer and detergent.
We are nestled on over 100 acres of land and are 1000 feet from the nearest highway.

A clean and cozy guesthouse with nice touches of hardwood and hard surfaces. 
  One bedroom has a queen bed and the other has a bunkbed and both include bedding and extra blankets.
  There is a living room with a 4k smart TV, LAN line,  wifi router, Fast internet (119 mbps), and Roku.
  A wooden deck provides a great place to sit outside and relax and entertain.
Very private, safe, and secure.  Absolutely no animals or pets  allowed.

You will have access to the guesthouse and some hiking trails on the property.

I enjoy talking to to the guest but understand the  importance of letting the guest have their space.  I can be contacted by text, phone, or in person.

Our place is only 6 minutes from Cabell Huntington  Hospital and 10 minutes to Marahall University.  We are located just 1.5 miles south of interstate 64 at exit 11 with the comforts of a rural country setting and the convenience of being close to town.  The space is cozy and private.  The property offers hiking trails and wildlife viewing for those wanting to get out in nature.

You'll be best traveling via car in the the Huntington area and a 4 wheel drive when the roads get snowy.

NO ANIMALS- NO SMOKING OR VAPING INSIDE-NO PARTIES-NO DRUGS.  
This is a new listing and it's a new venture for me and my family.    I concider it to be a exceptionally clean place with plenty of privacy and easy access to the interstate and downtown Huntington.","No pets.

This secluded property is nestled in a serene country setting on 40 acres, surrounded by hills, tall pines, and a pond-front view. Pure Country is a place to escape that gives all visitors the opportunity to flee from the fast-paced world. Just minutes from I-64, and the Huntington Tri-State Airport.

This spacious home offers a comfortable and relaxing stay for your vacation.

On the main level, you'll find three inviting bedrooms with cozy queen beds, ceiling fans, and flat screen TVs for your comfort and entertainment. Additionally, there are two full baths, ensuring convenience for all guests.

The upper deck, accessible from the kitchen area, provides the perfect spot to unwind and savor your morning coffee. Immerse yourself in the tranquil ambiance as you listen to the melodies of wildlife and the soothing sounds of nature.

Adjacent to the living area, you'll discover a fully equipped kitchen and dining area, complete with a microwave, dishwasher, and a convenient coffee and tea bar. We've also stocked the cookware you need to prepare delicious home-cooked meals. However, if cooking isn't part of your vacation plans, fret not! Numerous local restaurants are just a short drive away.

Relax and bond with your loved ones in the family room, where a cozy gas-burning fireplace awaits. Gather around and enjoy a movie together, with access to Wi-Fi and Dish Network for your entertainment needs.

The lower level of the house offers an additional spacious area with a well-equipped kitchen, perfect for prepping your meals before heading out to the gas grill just steps away.

Immerse yourself in the beauty of nature surrounding the property. Embark on a nature hike, find solace in a captivating book by the lake, or indulge in the tranquil activity of fishing. As dusk settles in, embrace the crackling fire and witness the enchanting sight of fireflies illuminating the night. Look up at the star-filled sky and let feelings of tranquility wash over you. Take a deep breath of the fresh country air and appreciate the wonders of our world.

We can't wait to host you and provide an unforgettable experience during your stay.

Hand wash and put always all used dishes directly after use. No dishes are allowed to remain dirty in the sink overnight. 

The cottage is environmentally friendly and I ask that you try to reuse bath towels. There are hooks for used towels in the bathroom and on the closet door of each room. 
Place used towels and washcloths that need laundered in laundry basket in hall. 

Please use vent fan in bathroom during showers to allow moisture to escape and prevent mildew buildup.

Lower level deck and lower area of the cottage are both off limits to guests.

The space is an open floor plan and has many cool design features. A 65"" TV with free WIFI and equipped with an Amazon Fire Stick for your viewing pleasure.

This property offers privacy and security for your family as well as your vehicles & UTV's. Not only is it perfect for UTV enthusiasts but families as well!

We typically let guests do self check in, sometimes my husband does like to meet the guests if he’s available when they arrive. We are here should any issues occur.

The cabin is close to the town but still secluded, a 24 hour gas station and restaurants are very close by.

The driveway is steep, any guest with a trailer will need a 4 wheel drive. Any large trailer will need to park on the flat right below the driveway. A 4wd is typically preferred but many cars have made it with no trouble. During the winter months of snow/ice should be present, access to the cabin could be difficult but parking and walking up is an option that others have done. We just like to make guests aware before arrival so they use their judgement.","See Rental Agreement for further info","We typically let guests do self check in, sometimes my husband does like to meet the guests if he’s available when they arrive.

Close enough to town (1.2 miles) that you can ride your ATV to the Hatfield McCoy trail, restaurants, grocery stores and gas stations yet far enough away that you don't hear the train come through town. The Devil Anse trail head is the closest trail, however it connects to the Buffalo Mountain and Rock House trail that you can ride all the way to the town of Gilbert. The 1 acre flat elevated lot provides privacy from neighbors and enough parking for all your trucks, trailers and ATV's. A power washer is provided to wash your ATV for no charge.

The entire house and yard are accessible to guests.

You can reach me anytime during your stay if you need anything.

Located in historic Matewan with direct access to trail 31 of the Devil Anse trail system there's no shortage of things to do. Whether riding your ATV on the famous trail system or visiting the historic sites of the Hatfield McCoy feud our town offers something for everyone.

he might enjoy listing one of his furnished apartments for short-term rental. The two of them had so much fun setting up the space for travelers that he has kept it going. Bill loves traveling and has been to various points around the USA, but nothing compares to his time spent in Uganda, East Africa (though he still claims West Virginia beats all!).

Guests have access to the entire Queen suite which includes large bathroom, closet, and private deck. Guests may also use the back yard area or fire pit (at their own risk).

We love to meet each of our guests but also realize that’s not always feasible. Our interaction can be as much or as little as our guests would like. We are a busy family so we are often not around in evenings. We offer self check in for all guests but are happy to show you to the room personally if you’d like! If you prefer your privacy, that’s fine by us! We love to recommend restaurants and other activities for guests to try in our small town...so please ask!

Riverlike Estates is a fairly large, quiet neighborhood located a few miles outside of Saint Albans, WV. It is perfect for walking, jogging, or cycling. Neighbors are very friendly! In the middle of the neighborhood is a lake where you may fish, as well as basketball court and play grounds. Secluded neighborhood gives a serene feel to the space.
Though it is a few miles from town it is still convenient to essential amenities. A Dollar General store and Par Mar Convenience store/gas station are both located within walking distance and other essentials (coffee shop, restaurants, post office, library, banks, laundry mat, grocery stores, etc) are only a couple minute (3-5 minute) drive back to town.

This space is located several miles from the nearest bus station and buses do not run to our neighborhood. Uber and Lyft (as well as local taxi service) are available if you do not have transportation of your own. Parking for your vehicle is provided in our driveway.

Please be aware that we do have children and pets. They will not be in your space, but you will definitely see ""signs of life"". Our Labradoodle Barnabas and his sidekick Goldendoodle Finn might greet you with a bark, and you'll see our children (or their toys) playing in the yard frequently. 

Check out time is no later than 10:00am. If you'd like a later check out you must let us know 48 hours prior to your arrival. A $10 fee will be assessed for later check out. Late check out will be granted based on availability. 

Check in time is 4:00pm or later. If you'd like earlier check-in you must let us know 48 hours prior to your arrival. A $10 fee will be assessed for early check-in. Early check in will only be granted based on availability. 

As listed in the amenities section, we have a TV in the space but no cable. Some guests choose to bring their own streaming device (FireStick, AppleTV, etc) or just use the DVD player we have available. 

Coffee is provided in room for your convenience as well as a few snacks and cold breakfast items (breakfast bars or oatmeal)

There is a mini fridge, electric kettle and microwave in the room for your use. 
 
We do have children in our home and while we attempt to keep the noise levels to a minimum, please know that it is likely that you will hear us throughout your stay.

This is a non-smoking space. Smoking is not permitted inside the suite.","While we love to welcome families with children, please be aware that our home backs up to a river. It takes a lot of effort to go down to the river, but if you’re bringing children please be aware of the dangers that could present themselves. Any danger that could arise from use of fire pits is a risk parents take when building a fire for their family to enjoy. Parents are responsible for the safety of their own children while on our property.

The house has been improved significantly from top to bottom, and side to side. I'll give you the tour and the historical narrative if you'd like.

Let me know of any special needs and I'll try to accommodate you.

There are any number of eateries in nearby Saint Albans. Just search ""The Ten Best Saint Albans WV Restaurants"".

Off street parking, but the nearest bus stop is 3 miles away.

Halloween is the busiest time of year. Kids and their parents come from miles around. The candy pounds per mile ratio is off the charts!

The Map is WRONG the location of my house is coming up the hill and staying up to the right on Village Drive!   Riverwalk has a Kroger , T.J.MAXX, and several restaurants.

Very easy access to Interstates 64&74& 77. Minutes to Thomas Memorial Hospital using Kanawha Turnpike.  Downtown South Charleston has many restaurants and a Antique Mall.

Parking notes;  Updated to reflect the new gravel parking area. If you have 3 trailers we recommend 2 of them being under 20' depending on tow vehicle length. If you have multiple longer Rigs or just want more space, there is also public parking for trucks/trailers in town. This would allow for parking longer rigs and just driving your SXS / ORV to the house.","Our home is designed for a maximum of 6 guests.

Covid control notice:  to ensure a sanitized air environment for our guests and property personnel, we have installed dual zone RGF REME and Air Guardian units.  We are the first and only known location in the state of WV at this time having this level of air purification with these quality USA made devices.  We have used it for years but this year we increased to dual-zone. We are also committed to proper cleaning and laundering, but this additional REME step puts our location in a class of its own for respiratory health and protection.  We are already located in an area having exceptionally low case counts.  More than socially distance yourself in West Virginia - the mountains that surround us became our protection.   In our opinion, the mature hardwood trees on steep mountain sides create dense levels of fresh oxygen that cannot exist in flat city landscapes, if think about it. 

Statement from RGF:   The Guardian Air QR+ utilizes RGF’s patented PHI-Cell® technology and is easily mounted onto your existing air conditioning and heating system air ducts. When the HVAC system is in operation, the Guardian QR+ creates an advanced oxidation plasma (AOP) that is distributed through the duct system into the conditioning living space. Unlike passive air technologies, which need pollutants to pass through the unit for purification or filtration, the Guardian QR+ sweeps through our home actively purifying pollutants at the source. The advanced oxidation plasma consists of hydro-peroxides, oxide ions and hydroxide ions. All are friendly oxidizers that are found in nature’s process of cleaning the outdoor air and are safe for humans and animals alike.

The Guardian QR+ is an air purifier.   It does not reduce particulate matter like dust - but the AC deep pleat filters do. We have added a REME HALO for air purifier with added particulate reduction and that is even more effective at removing these allergens. 

REME HALO 
 Dual ionizers to reduce airborne particulates (dust, dander, pollen, mold spores)
• Kills up to 99% of bacteria, mold and viruses
• REME® reduces sneeze germs by 99% in the time a sneeze can reach three feet.
• New zinc ions kill 99% of viruses on surfaces
• Unlike portable units that are limited to the room in which they are placed, the REME HALO® provides whole home and building purification.
• Easily integrated with your existing HVAC system. The unit doesn’t take away living space and operates silently.
• Incorporates an adjustable REME® cell, which allows customization of the advanced oxidation plasma output.

We have ran these units at Chapmanville for 3 years now and for an additional 8 years in other residences of our and our family members.  

further RGF info: 
U.S. Military approved for mold reduction in field hospitals.
• U.S. and International Hospital approval for the fight against infectious diseases: 99% reduction of Staph (MRSA).
• Major U.S. city school test reports 20% reduction in absenteeism.
• Tested and approved by Asian Government for protection against the deadly SARS virus.
• Approved by the USDA, FSIS, and FDA for use in food processing plants. Employed to reduce microbial contamination of food being processed.
• Cruise lines use it as a safety measure against Norwalk Virus outbreaks.

The REME HALO® is installed in a wide variety of residential, commercial and industrial applications where a ducted HVAC system exists. Here are some examples:
• Single family homes, apartments, condos
• In hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and doctor’s offices
• Schools, daycare centers, colleges and universities
• Fitness centers, locker rooms, athletic facilities
• Office buildings
• Veterinary clinics, animal hospitals, kennels,
• Hotels, motels, and resorts.
• Food processing and manufacturing plants/facilities
• Restaurants, diners, and bars

We utilize two Wifi heat pump thermostats to maintain a set temperature range for the two systems.  It is remotely managed.  The fall/winter heat pump default is 70Heat-73AC.  If you run colder in the winter let us know and we can adjust it down to 68Heat-72AC a day before check in.  We also leave a out dehumidifier out downstairs (please help by emptying into downstairs sink or bathtub) to keep humidity down lower, its easy and takes 1 minute.

Please note - in general we dont accept guests with 0 reviews or unverified status.  For those new to airbnb, all guests must submit a valid photo ID along with full name and reply to this request with clear photos send  inside the Airbnb app within 24 hours of booking.  The guest count must reflect the number of ID’s submitted.  Non-response to this request will result in cancellation and refund of fees per airbnb policy.  Our property manager will verify guests and ID the day of arrival.

Entire house.  Each room has an available closet and dressers.  There are two bathrooms upstairs and one downstairs.  The master bedroom has its own complete bathroom with a standing shower with a separate personal bathtub-4 jet Jacuzzi that fills and then drains after each use.  The house house sits dry, well up above the road and is connected by a 470' paved  blacktop driveway which joins the house to an overflow, remote paved 30x30 parking lot.   Guests are provided password WIFI access to the new  gigabyte internet service that has been benchmarking from 46-292MB/sec download and 42-50MB/sec on our 2.4 and 5G WiFi networks indoors and on decks outside.

Guests needing access to laundry facility - there is a local/small Laundramat in downtown Chapmanville that is 4mi/6min away.  740 Main St, Chapmanville, WV 25508.  Coins are available at the nearby spray-off car wash changer to the right/north on rt 10 a few hundred yards.

The property manager is nearby and accessible.  We also have a 2-way-talk/video RING doorbell on the front porch to contact our cellphones directly 24 hours a day.  The area has good Wifi coverage of 5g and 2.4g with AC/MIMO.  Wifi password is available on request for guests and provided in the guest document after the reservation is complete.

The neighborhood is rural-country.   We are on a hill above a nice flat.   Its a big home that can hold a large family or group of friends.  

The area is very pretty and also WV upscale.  Although it is rural, its still about 30min to s. charleston and about 15 min to super=big box stores that have expanded to our county.  highway 119 that connects us to town is a nice, well kept divided 4 lane highway.  We do have former governors on the street that retired to the area because of its charm and privacy.   Its one of the best kept secrets of WV.

In WV coalfield counties (Logan, Mingo, Boone,Lincoln...) you can drive on ATV or UTV marked streets legally to and from trailheads and into small towns (provided you have a valid HMT sticker on your helmet and you obey traffic laws).  You cannot drive a non-plated ATV/UTV on a divided 4-lane highway like RT 119 or the new interstate 4 lane section of rt 10 from logan to man (okay to safely cross it, just dont drive down the highway like cars do).  The old Rt10 is still there and that is ATV okay.  Many towns in SW West Virginia ( AKA the Devil's Den) are offroad-friendly - driving is a privilege, not a right - so be respectful.  Bring a Harley AND your UTV -- because our blacktop road are just as fun as our offroad trails.  Tow your Harley here with your JEEP and have the best of both worlds.  If you are riding from town to a trailhead on the backroads or into town - make CERTAIN you have a valid HMT decal on the helmet left side and your matching drivers license.   Many local gas stations sell the HMT annual permit stickers (eg. Lil Gen/Burger King @ 100 Old Co 3/3 Rd, Chapmanville, WV 25508) and there are also a few welcome centers on 119 always having stickers available.  Active Military ID from any state will get you the HMT in-state rates at the welcome center!   Also remember WV is a helmet-required state when riding on the road !

We recommend downloading a good GPS App with Topo on your phone.  Note that since “location” GPS is turned on inside your phone this consumes battery at a faster rate - so USB power batteries are a wise investment.  The apps and maps you download are not small files, so download them first on wifi and you might need to clear off or expand SD memory cards.   Sample apps:  I hike gps: topo,  maps 3D pro,  GPS tracks.   We have good wifi at the house to download these files/apps.  You probably wont have LTE cellular on the trail, so download them at home or at the 5G tower base at the Chapmanville Rt10 exit.  

G00gle maps and apple’s maps have topographical (topo) features but they dont record your trail like a GPS tracker app.  Both maps would need to be downloaded before your journey..

Country Roads Byways Visitors Center and Jeep Trailhead / Chapmanville /  12 minutes on i-119  Or 8 miles on backroads without using a trailer from the house.  This HMT trailhead allows Jeeps/RangeRovers in addition to UTV/ATV/MX.  It’s near logan/chapmanville superwalmart.  It has over 100 miles of mountain Green and Blue trails that can be navigated with a stock Jeep wrangler unlimited, weather permitting over a long weekend.  It has another 50 miles of black-dot expert trails require external cage structure installed on the Jeep.   They are serious rock-crawling level trails that are best with an extra  person navigating and often marking outside the truck, front/rear winch, lift & articulation kits. Expect body dents and severe levels of drive-train stress on black dot Jeep trails.  You may get a few paint scratches on far ends of blue dot trails, but green trails only need 4wd locked out in a few sections or if its really wet.  WV trails are very steep and drain off quickly.  The day after rain has firm soil with ideal conditions.  During rain is challenging and slick.  A run with snow is also ideal, due to the beauty of the mountains !!!

Rural WV Communication:  when at the house, plan to coordinate contacting your away crew over our WiFi connection with apps like: Whats App, Text, e-Mail, WiFi-Calling, VOIP,  Messenger, GoogleVoice...   Although we have steady high speed WiFi inside the house and around it, expect that cellular service is weak when your more than a mile off 119.  There is a powerful cell tower 2 miles away (i-119 in chapmanville), but most use our home wifi to connect.   5G cellular on the T-mobile network was installed 3/2020 on a mountain tower between our road and downtown Chapmanville.  We are on the edge of the signal - some phones pick up, others wont.   We do have gigabyte level service inside the house that is available for guest use on our dual bands 5G and 2.4G WiFi networks.

Also, we have backroad access to the Chapmanville Rt3 connector for bear wallow.  Its about 6 miles of scenic backroads on ATV, no trailering.  That’s the fastest way to access HMT and from there you can also connect through 2-3 other systems all the way to Kentucky.  Its a lot of riding.  

Trailer-only with no trail-to-trail connections for systems at Country Roads, and Warrior.   Country Roads is the nearest pass store @ 12 miles/12 min and the main trailer lot for Bear Wallow is 4 miles past that.  Check current covid regs in effect.  There is also a local gas station even closer with hours from 5am to midnight to buy the helmet  sticker pass.  that we can usually arrange with that gas station manager to hold and keep stickers on hand for our guests, upon an advance request.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. No parties or events may be held at the Loft or on the property. 
2. No overnight guests other than those registered and approved when making the reservation online. If you are expecting visitors for a short period of time during your stay, please let your hosts know.
3. No pets are permitted without prior permission and with an additional pet charge of $25 per pet (maximum one large dog or two small dogs). Sorry, no cats are permitted ever. We have four (friendly) dogs so we will need to coordinate yard usage to avoid any possible problems. Please clean up after your pet! Pets may not be left unattended for more than 2 hours and must be in a kennel/travel carrier. If you need assistance finding a dog-sitter please contact your hosts ahead of time.
4. Trash cans and bags are provided in the Loft (under the sink in the kitchen and bathroom). If the cans get full during your stay, please take the trash out and put in one of the trash cans in, or by, the driveway. No need to take out the trash at the end of your stay.
5. No hair dying or coloring is permitted in the Loft.
6. We do not have child safety features; children are welcome if you accept liability and are comfortable knowing we have no child proofing along with many stairs.
7. Minors under the age of 18 must be accompanied, in person AT ALL TIMES, by an adult over 21. You must be 21 to book a reservation at the Loft.
8. The antler hooks by the door will not hold heavy loads. Please only hang light jackets and clothing on them.
9. Please clean your boots/shoes as well as you can before entering the building and use the boot tray upstairs by the door for your boots and shoes.
10. Please do not block neighbor’s driveways, including the apartment’s next door. We will do what we can to help you with parking (including our driveway and street parking in front of our house). Please let us know if you’re traveling with a trailer so we can help you plan for parking.
11. If you would like to sit outside, you are welcome to use the camp chairs at the bottom of the stairs. If it is raining or too sunny, feel free to sit under the carport by the house. If we are parked there, just send us a message during daytime hours (9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) and we’ll move our car: we want you to enjoy your stay! You can also sit in the backyard but be aware that our dogs will occasionally need to be let out. If you are using the yard and/or grill, we will check with you before letting out the dogs. When sitting outside after 9 p.m. please try to keep the noise down so as not to disturb the residents and neighbors.
12. Do not go out on the roof. While it looks like a great place to hang out, it’s not safe for people and walking on the shingles are likely to cause damage.
13. Without exception, no smoking, vaping or marijuana usage inside the Loft. Please don’t think it can be covered up, it cannot. We have to extensively clean to remove the contaminant before other guests can arrive. Neutralizing this contaminant inside requires a $100 minimum service fee. Feel free to step outside in the back yard and quietly enjoy a tobacco smoke or vape; you'll just need to police your butts.
14. Before you leave, please wash any dishes that you used. Clean dishes can be left in the drainer to dry and we’ll put them away.
15. No need to strip the bed or pile up used towels and washcloths upon departure but during your stay, please hang wet towels and washcloths on the towel racks, shower curtain rod or side of the bathtub.
16. Please lock the door at the bottom of the steps whenever you leave the premises, including your departure.

You'll have a private entrance to the Loft at the end of the driveway with access through a digital keypad deadbolt lock.","human","Great place near Hatfield & McCoy trailheads! The Foggy Mountain Loft has the feel of a mountain hideaway but in town, close to where you want to play & eat. There's a private entrance to this simple guest loft above the garage behind our home. You'll find a basic kitchenette, full bathroom, Roku TV and WiFi. At over 50 years old, the Loft shows its age with multiple layers of paint and years of cosmetic repairs, but it has been recently renovated to create a safe, clean & comfortable space.

The Foggy Mountain Loft is a single L-shaped room which has a double bed, futon couch, and a full bathroom with bathtub and shower. You can use our Adirondack chairs to spend time outside or stay in and watch your streaming apps on the Roku TV. There isn't a stove or oven in the Loft but there is a microwave, coffee maker, hot water kettle, toaster, air fryer and electric skillet for simple food preparation, and a grill in the garage you can use upon request.  There are also many great restaurants in Logan just a few minutes away.

Foggy Mountain Loft is on a residential street near town with free on-street parking. If you're towing a trailer, we'll try to save the spaces in front of the house for you with prior arrangement or you can use our driveway. You'll have a private entrance to the Loft at the end of the driveway with access through a digital keypad deadbolt lock.

We're available during your stay for assistance or to answer questions but you'll have as much privacy as you're looking for.

There are many places to eat in Logan and a lot of things to do:

Chief Logan State Park: 5.6 miles
Chief Logan Recreation Center: 8.2 miles
Dunks Body Shop (Gym): 12.5 miles
H & M Bearwallow Trail connector: 1 mile
H & M Bearwallow Trailhead: 4.1 miles
H & M Rockhouse Trailhead: 13.8 miles
H & M Buffalo Mountain Trailhead: 28 miles
H & M Devil Anse Trailhead: 34.6 miles

Gas station (which usually has the cheapest gas in Logan) is just about a mile away (just past the coffee house and bakery...)!

On street parking is easy to find near Foggy Mountain Loft. If you're raveling with a trailer you'll be able to find a spot within a couple blocks of the Loft. With prior arrangement, guests traveling with a trailer can have the parking spaces in front of  our house saved by us until their arrival or can park in the driveway (pulling truck into carport, there's room for a trailer with one ATV).

This is a 2nd floor loft with a narrow staircase, so you'll need to keep an eye on small children and keep in mind your own ability to climb stairs.","1. No parties or events may be held at the Loft or on the property. 
2. No overnight guests other than those registered and approved when making the reservation online. If you are expecting visitors for a short period of time during your stay, please let your hosts know.
3. No pets are permitted without prior permission and with an additional pet charge of $25 per pet (maximum one large dog or two small dogs). Sorry, no cats are permitted ever. We have four (friendly) dogs so we will need to coordinate yard usage to avoid any possible problems. Please clean up after your pet! Pets may not be left unattended for more than 2 hours and must be in a kennel/travel carrier. If you need assistance finding a dog-sitter please contact your hosts ahead of time.
4. Trash cans and bags are provided in the Loft (under the sink in the kitchen and bathroom). If the cans get full during your stay, please take the trash out and put in one of the trash cans in, or by, the driveway. No need to take out the trash at the end of your stay.
5. No hair dying or coloring is permitted in the Loft.
6. We do not have child safety features; children are welcome if you accept liability and are comfortable knowing we have no child proofing along with many stairs.
7. Minors under the age of 18 must be accompanied, in person AT ALL TIMES, by an adult over 21. You must be 21 to book a reservation at the Loft.
8. The antler hooks by the door will not hold heavy loads. Please only hang light jackets and clothing on them.
9. Please clean your boots/shoes as well as you can before entering the building and use the boot tray upstairs by the door for your boots and shoes.
10. Please do not block neighbor’s driveways, including the apartment’s next door. We will do what we can to help you with parking (including our driveway and street parking in front of our house). Please let us know if you’re traveling with a trailer so we can help you plan for parking.
11. If you would like to sit outside, you are welcome to use the camp chairs at the bottom of the stairs. If it is raining or too sunny, feel free to sit under the carport by the house. If we are parked there, just send us a message during daytime hours (9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) and we’ll move our car: we want you to enjoy your stay! You can also sit in the backyard but be aware that our dogs will occasionally need to be let out. If you are using the yard and/or grill, we will check with you before letting out the dogs. When sitting outside after 9 p.m. please try to keep the noise down so as not to disturb the residents and neighbors.
12. Do not go out on the roof. While it looks like a great place to hang out, it’s not safe for people and walking on the shingles are likely to cause damage.
13. Without exception, no smoking, vaping or marijuana usage inside the Loft. Please don’t think it can be covered up, it cannot. We have to extensively clean to remove the contaminant before other guests can arrive. Neutralizing this contaminant inside requires a $100 minimum service fee. Feel free to step outside in the back yard and quietly enjoy a tobacco smoke or vape; you'll just need to police your butts.
14. Before you leave, please wash any dishes that you used. Clean dishes can be left in the drainer to dry and we’ll put them away.
15. No need to strip the bed or pile up used towels and washcloths upon departure but during your stay, please hang wet towels and washcloths on the towel racks, shower curtain rod or side of the bathtub.
16. Please lock the door at the bottom of the steps whenever you leave the premises, including your departure.","We're available during your stay for assistance or to answer questions but you'll have as much privacy as you're looking for.","en","English","Foggy Mountain Loft near Hatfield & McCoy Trails","There are many places to eat in Logan and a lot of things to do:
