This is a vacation rental agreement under the North Carolina Vacation Rental Act.  The rights and obligations of the parties to this agreement are defined by law and include unique provisions permitting the disbursement of rent prior to tenancy and expedited eviction of tenants.  Your signature on this agreement, or payment of money, or taking possession of the property after receipt of this agreement, is evidence of your acceptance of the agreement and your intent to use this property for a vacation rental.  Rentals exceeding 90 days do not fall under the NC vacation rental management act and are not subject to the same protections adhered to by the NC Vacation Rental Management Act.

Maximum occupancy must be strictly adhered to.  Occupancy count includes children.  Exceeding the occupancy limit set for your unit is ground for immediate eviction.  No exceptions and no refunds!

Accidental Damage Protector & Security Deposits:  The Accidental Damage Protection Plan is included in the advertised total amount and indemnifies you and your family up to $1500 for any accidental damage during your stay. All accidental damage must be reported to our office in writing by the end of renter’s stay in order for Damage Protector to apply.  Damage Protector is a surety contract and is not insurance.  RRR is not an insurer, insurance agent or underwriter.  The Accidental Damage Protection is non refundable.  Damage Protector does NOT cover intentional damage, excessive cleaning, theft, Acts of God, gross negligence, pet damage, utilities, rent, pay for view cable charges, additional costs incurred during stay per renter’s request, or loss of use.  Any intentional property damage or items listed above will be billed to the renter and may be charged to renter’s account or credit card on file without renter’s consent if RRR is unable to contact renter to request authorization.  

A security deposit can be elected in lieu of Accidental Damage Protection.  The cost ranges from $200 to $800 depending on the rental unit.  It is fully refundable by mail within 30 days of departure providing no damages have been made to the unit and the unit has been left tidy (according to our check out procedures) or (less any allowable deductions).  The security deposit can be paid in advance by personal check, money order, certified funds or credit card. Security deposits paid upon arrival must be paid by cash or credit card only. 

A few homes may require an additional security deposit beyond what is required above in this rental agreement.  The renter agrees to reimburse the homeowner for any damages to the property caused by renter that are in excess of, or not covered by Damage Protector or the security deposit.  Such damages shall include reasonable attorney fees and court costs.  The provisions of Article 5, Chapter 42A of the North Carolina General Statutes (Landlord and tenant Duties) are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth.

The renter fully understands that RRR is a rental agency engaging in the rental of private property of others.  RRR reserves the right to refuse service to anyone RRR feels will not be responsible for the property he/she is renting. RRR does not rent to anyone under the age of 21.  Each rental unit requires a person 21 or older to rent and sign the rental contract.  This person must be present at check-in and for duration of rental.  Renter understands that RRR has the right to terminate this agreement, re-enter the unit, or take necessary measures to remove the renter from the premises in the event renter and guests violates the conditions of this agreement.  RRR is not responsible for the loss or theft of clothing, money, jewelry, etc. and is not be held liable for any accidents or injury of any nature.  RRR reserves the right to move any reservation that might come about due to unforeseen circumstances (house sold, out of rental program, owner’s use, act of God, etc.)  Under no circumstances is the obligation of RRR more than that of refunding the renter’s deposit. Rates are subject to all applicable taxes.  Rates are subject to change with notice.

Accommodations: All of our vacation properties are individually owned and reflect each owner’s taste.  Rearranging of furniture is not permitted. If you have specific standards or requirements for your vacation residence we advise personal inspection of the property prior to making reservations. Burning wood in any gas fireplace is prohibited and subject to forfeiture of security deposit.  Grilling is not permitted on any porches, decks or walkways.  All units are provided with enough garbage bags, paper towels, dishwashing detergent, bath soap, and toilet paper to get you started.

Renter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless RRR and the owner from and against any liability for personal injury or property damage sustained by any person (including renter’s guests) as a result of any cause, unless caused by the negligent or willful act of RRR or the owner, or the failure of the RRR or the owner to comply with the Vacation Rental Act.  Renter agrees that RRR, the owner or their respective representatives may enter the premises during reasonable hours to inspect the premises, to make such repairs, alterations or improvements thereto as RRR or owner may deem appropriate, or to show the premises to perspective purchasers or renters.

RRR does not guarantee any weather, road or ski conditions and there will be no refund as a result of either.  Transportation is the sole responsibility of the renter.  Snow tires, chains or 4-wheel drive is mandatory during adverse weather as stated by Sugar Mountain law.

There will be no refund for weather related issues.  This includes but is not limited to lack of snow or inclement weather preventing the renters’ arrival.  We strongly recommend accepting the travel insurance to assist with obtaining refunds for these situations. No refunds are made for early departures or no shows.

This is a vacation rental agreement under the North Carolina Vacation Rental Act.  The rights and obligations of the parties to this agreement are defined by law and include unique provisions permitting the disbursement of rent prior to tenancy and expedited eviction of tenants.  Your signature on this agreement, or payment of money, or taking possession of the property after receipt of this agreement, is evidence of your acceptance of the agreement and your intent to use this property for a vacation rental.  Rentals exceeding 90 days do not fall under the NC vacation rental management act and are not subject to the same protections adhered to by the NC Vacation Rental Management Act.

Maximum occupancy must be strictly adhered to.  Occupancy count includes children.  Exceeding the occupancy limit set for your unit is ground for immediate eviction.  No exceptions and no refunds!

Accidental Damage Protector & Security Deposits:  The Accidental Damage Protection Plan is included in the advertised total amount and indemnifies you and your family up to $1500 for any accidental damage during your stay. All accidental damage must be reported to our office in writing by the end of renter’s stay in order for Damage Protector to apply.  Damage Protector is a surety contract and is not insurance.  RRR is not an insurer, insurance agent or underwriter.  The Accidental Damage Protection is non refundable.  Damage Protector does NOT cover intentional damage, excessive cleaning, theft, Acts of God, gross negligence, pet damage, utilities, rent, pay for view cable charges, additional costs incurred during stay per renter’s request, or loss of use.  Any intentional property damage or items listed above will be billed to the renter and may be charged to renter’s account or credit card on file without renter’s consent if RRR is unable to contact renter to request authorization.  

A security deposit can be elected in lieu of Accidental Damage Protection.  The cost ranges from $200 to $800 depending on the rental unit.  It is fully refundable by mail within 30 days of departure providing no damages have been made to the unit and the unit has been left tidy (according to our check out procedures) or (less any allowable deductions).  The security deposit can be paid in advance by personal check, money order, certified funds or credit card. Security deposits paid upon arrival must be paid by cash or credit card only. 

A few homes may require an additional security deposit beyond what is required above in this rental agreement.  The renter agrees to reimburse the homeowner for any damages to the property caused by renter that are in excess of, or not covered by Damage Protector or the security deposit.  Such damages shall include reasonable attorney fees and court costs.

The residence is conveniently positioned within a short stroll from Tazewell Main Street on a 3.16-acre lot. The Johnston family erected the house to showcase their accomplishments because they were highly renowned in thier native Virginia.

Designed for couples,This historic filling station was acquired,gutted and purposely rebuilt for you,the discerning traveler,the parents of the students, or the traveling Doctor or Nurse. Designed in an urban industrial style, he unit is completely smart enabled,handicap accessible and overflowing with amenities that you would only expect from the most well known 5 star resorts. 15% Military Discount.

Welcome to the Carbon Flat. This is a multi-faceted passion project that not only offers housing for the parents of the University students, but is also in an effort to invest in the local community  and help grow much needed infrastructure.  This building was acquired, redesigned, gutted, stripped, and purposely rebuilt FOR you. I applied myself, thoroughly researched the concept of airbnb, developed a plan, and am now implementing that plan for ""TOP OF THE LINE EXPERIENCE AND SERVICE"",  In which I have provided for more than a decade.  I built and operated an Ultra exclusive boutique beach resort In Southeast Asia. As well as a beach lounge and restaurant that was considered ""the living room"" of Khao-Lak Beach, Thailand. I have lived and traveled abroad extensively, which I do believe lends to One's ability to recognize, appreciate,  and implement, this level of service. 

From the exterior. I chose to design the building in a very trendy ""urban industrial"" monochromatic color scheme which uses a lot of one color in different hues. For this project I chose, carbonized grey. Hence the name, The Carbon Flat. I accentuated this dark and sort of  'blah' color with western red cedar, that I stained Mahogany Flame. It is quite dramatic, yet calming. I highlighted certain areas in stone, and others with foliage from local plants.  We installed a wheelchair accessible, concrete ramp, at a 3 degree gradient, to not only allow for a wheelchair, but also make it easier for luggage and minimize someone tripping. 

 On to the inside....

Posh, yet practical. Again, I put thought into every decision, researching what had the best reviews for comfort and functionality, while also balancing  function with form and design. I wanted to bring a little of the out side in, so I used a much more subtle grey, almost blue Pallet. I Then painted the  oak cabinets with the carbonized grey from outside. Additionally I used  western red cedar with the same  Is mahogany flame stain for crown molding. For a focal point, I had a custom mural done on the largest  wall. Its very thought provoking and perfect for the space which by the numbers seems small but with 12 foot high ceilings, makes it feel so much bigger.  I built and installed custom Acacia wood butcher block counter tops, with a Kraus workstation sink That I believe was intended to give a  farmhouse look, but it only lends to this funky design. It has a  built in chopping block and dish drainer. 

The kitchen was stocked with everything that a chef would appreciate. From  beautiful Damascus steel knives, to an Air fryer range that's front controlled and ADA compliant. Coffee and tea lovers? There is a Nespresso Machine that makes the absolute best coffee, stocked with Nespresso's best  coffee offerings as well as from Starbucks and other favorites. . There is a French Press, Bodum Pour over, Krups Noiseless grinder, and several different options for coffee in  fresh bean form in case you wanted to make your travelling companion their first pour over. Double walled glass  cappuccino and espresso mugs, and milk frother.  Individually wrapped tea bags from Twinning's, Taylors of Harrogate, Harford and Sons, and individually wrapped loose leaf tea from all over the world. There is an authentic cast iron Tetsubin  Japanese Tea set that, by the artist, was named after Rikyu (Rentarô Mikuni), a Buddhist priest who believes in the spiritual healing inherent in the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. There’s a Fellow Stagg EKG Digital kettle that’s ranked #1 by baristas and has a beautiful design. The best pour, for your pour-over. And only the best for you. 

Appreciate nice bath towels, or quality sleep? I chose to use  UGG Pacha line Turkish Cotton (and oversized) for all of the bath towels, hand towels, and wash cloths. I  Used UGG for most of the comforters and throws, and there will be several options for the guests when it comes to pillows and sheets, in case you don’t like the crazy high thread count Egyptian cotton ones that will be on the 14 inch hybrid, and fully adjustable bed. Makes it nice if you want to set the head up so you can watch the 75  inch tv,  with amazon prime, local cable, and top it off , a service that gives you every single cable channel from around the world, in different languages, including every single  pay per view event. It also has every single movie that comes out in theaters sometimes while they are still in the theaters. This is a legal service so there are no movies recorded with cellphones. I enjoy high quality Audio but had never bought anything from Klipsch. I wont ever buy anything else again.  You have a Klipsch Three 11 in the flat.   Bose, Sonos, eat your heart out. To sweeten the audio experience, is a fully automatic Audio Technica record player and a nice selection of records from every genre. Just let me know what tickles your fancy and it will be playing for you when you walk through the door. For you business travelers, there is  a wireless printer for your use. 

The lounging furniture are top grain leather , fully reclinable, with adjustable head and footrest, and lumbar also  with built in wireless charging for your phones. I have provided a few reading options including newer books, and a few dating all the way back to the 1850’s. Its really neat to look through them and compare societal differences of then and now and the amazing art done on old school press plates. There are few tastefully chosen board games. A bookcase edition scrabble, and a Luxury Edition Monopoly.  I built  a little area with accompaniments for adult beverages, and a nice Westin orange  juicer, which will always be accompanied by  fresh fruit, in case you would like to get up in the morning and juice some oranges for your “better half”. 

For you adult beverage drinkers there is a nice selection of glass ware. Vintage Paulaner Hefeweizen Glasses, which there are several already in the freezer for you. Huge Bordeaux glasses, glasses for white, lowballs, highballs and if you do partake please let me know in comments when you book that you are ""RED"" or ""WHITE"" and there will be such a thing in the gift basket for you.  

Custom built dining table made from Baltic Beechwood and then a triple coat of epoxy. I built this on an electric, noiseless air frame. You can raise and lower this table from 25 inches all the way up to 48 inches . Feel like standing,  great, sitting, even better. Disabled, I built this for you.  I think I blew ADA Compliant Standards out of the water on This  one. 

Last, but not least. The Bathroom. Continuing the décor, I installed  beautiful stone tile flooring, did the walls in a mute industrial concrete waterproof wallpaper. There is a really cool internally lit vanity mirror with a defogger that does not allow it to  get steamed up. My vision to work with local artists and craftsmen to showcase their work was fulfilled in the floating vanity and sink.  99timbers custom designed and built a live edge undermount and backsplash. It matches the beautiful foil-work sink . This sink is wheelchair accessible. There is a walk-in (or roll-in) modern steam shower. I chose grey stack stone and stunning turquoise subway tile, accentuated again by (a water suitable) choice of wood. Teak Floors and Teak Bench. This shower is 60 inches wide and 36 inches deep. It is wheelchair accessible. There is a 10 inch Kohler rain deluge, 8 body jets and an hand wand. Pressure? got pressure for days!!  Hot water you ask, well , I'm sure someone is going to test out that auto defog mirror. Its definitely a steam shower.  There are Turkish Cotton robes behind the bathroom door in multiple sizes for men and women. There is 3 different levels of toiletries based on the length of your stay. Our standard is  L'occitane Mer & Mistral,  If you're staying 3 nights or more you will receive Aprey Purple Water  (Exclusively used by the Ritz Carlton) if you choose to stay 5 nights or more you will receive  Hermès  eau d' orange vert.  Regardless of which level, you will receive shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and body lotion.  There will also be an individually wrapped bar soap from Marseilles.

The unit is completly ""smart"" enabled. You can control everything with your voice. Lights, thermostat, doorlock, T.V.,  Alarm System, Vacuum cleanet. You can ask to see the doorbell camera and your vehicle on the 8 in screen in the Kitchen.  There is also another 5 inch screen. Both of these have manual camera shutters, and by protocol are never opened by me. If you choose to use them for video calling, you are doing so on your own accord. The only thing in the flat that is not smart controlled are the 2 chandeliers. There is too much wattage going through them. There is Also a hidden safe for your valuables. 

I hope you are ok with smart technology. There  is a virtual concierge that will greet you by name as you come in the front door and ask if you are formally checking in.  You will be given a menu of options, or you can ask exactly what you want. I have spent a great deal of time, programming information Such as info about the property , info on anything inside the flat and how to use it, restaurants, things to do, places to see, family friendly activities, hiking, shopping, etc...I have worked with many local restaurants and stores securing exclusive discount coupons for you, but you have to use the virtual concierge.  I have attached many pictures and videos,  of things in the flat that explain things better. So if you don't know how to make a pour over, it will teach you. 

I'm not going to list every little detail. I can only GUARANTEE you will not find anything like it locally, or for this price.  IF you do ill honor my guarantee and give you a weekend for free.

 I am also trying to set the bar for a different kind of service and go above and beyond. If you choose to book and will be staying at the flat long enough to need groceries, You can place a click list order and I will happily pick them up and have them stocked at the flat for you.  Local grocery store options are Kroger, Walmart, and Food Lion.

My father, myself, and generations in my family served in The United States Military. I am proud, and grateful  in offering a 15% military discount for Active Duty or former service members.  Please let me know before booking so that I can send you  the special offer. I would also ask that you provide some sort of verification.,  ie,  base card, VA ID, or DD214. You would want to think that no one would lie about serving in the military for a discount, but we all know better. This is actually a Federal crime punishable under The Stolen Valor Act of 2013 (revised from 2005).

Outside of the flat there are 2 parking spaces solely dedicated  for your use. You then have the sidewalk that winds all the way through the University. It is maintained by the University. For Security, there is the WVU Tech Campus Police and the Beckley Police Department. I have worked closely with both, not only offering to provide a live link to my camera systems, but also taking several other measures to ensure the safety and security of the students, community members, and you!

I will be available at a whim, if anything were needed, for any reason.

Located within the WVU Tech University District, You can walk to any area of the University within 5 minutes.  WVU Tech has also allocated and broken ground on a new dormitory literally across the road from the flat . In literally 10 seconds from the front door you can walk to Jimmy's Place, a local bar, that had been open since the 1960's, but shut down because of Covid 19. Fortunately, a local business owner has opened it back up and is serving food.  The carbon flat is located in the University district but the property behind the flat Is completely wooded..an urban landscape. There are two windows with views of this.

IF you are driving by car , there are two parking spaces in front of the airbnb dedicated solely for your use. Other than that the usual options are available, taxi, uber, public transportation. If you are in need of any information, please let me know and iIwill provide you everything.

#The Carbon Flat goes above and beyond some standards that even 5 star resorts don't implement. 
Firstly we care very much about the air that you breath. We implement a system that you can access, by Bluetooth, our air filtration system, and view the statistics and real time data such as when the filter was changed, and the air quality you are breathing. 

#We also take cleaning extremely serious, and have written protocols (S.O.P's) as to using a ozone generator each time a guest departs. We do this  before we even go in to clean. This prevents us from coming into contact with anything while changing the bed, vacuuming, etc. The ozone machine completely, (even cracks and crevices) kills all bacteria, viruses, mold, and any un thinkables. 

#IF you are handicapped and travelling alone, or travelling with someone but still have some restrictions,  I offer my services to help if I am able, in any way, as I had said before, my father was Quadriplegic for 33 years. I helped with EVERYTHING.  I am cpr certified, and combat medical trained from my time in the military. I offer this at no charge. You can contact me personally, if you would like to inquire about this.","No unregistered guests

#IF you are handicapped and travelling alone, or travelling with someone but still have some restrictions,  I offer my services to help if I am able, in any way, as I had said before, my father was Quadriplegic for 33 years. I helped with EVERYTHING.  I am cpr certified, and combat medical trained from my time in the military. I offer this at no charge. You can contact me personally, if you would like to inquire about this.","Welcome to the Carbon Flat. This is a multi-faceted passion project that not only offers housing for the parents of the University students, but is also in an effort to invest in the local community  and help grow much needed infrastructure.  This building was acquired, redesigned, gutted, stripped, and purposely rebuilt FOR you. I applied myself, thoroughly researched the concept of airbnb, developed a plan, and am now implementing that plan for ""TOP OF THE LINE EXPERIENCE AND SERVICE"",  In which I have provided for more than a decade.  I built and operated an Ultra exclusive boutique beach resort In Southeast Asia. As well as a beach lounge and restaurant that was considered ""the living room"" of Khao-Lak Beach, Thailand. I have lived and traveled abroad extensively, which I do believe lends to One's ability to recognize, appreciate,  and implement, this level of service. 

From the exterior. I chose to design the building in a very trendy ""urban industrial"" monochromatic color scheme which uses a lot of one color in different hues. For this project I chose, carbonized grey. Hence the name, The Carbon Flat. I accentuated this dark and sort of  'blah' color with western red cedar, that I stained Mahogany Flame. It is quite dramatic, yet calming. I highlighted certain areas in stone, and others with foliage from local plants.  We installed a wheelchair accessible, concrete ramp, at a 3 degree gradient, to not only allow for a wheelchair, but also make it easier for luggage and minimize someone tripping. 

 On to the inside....

Posh, yet practical. Again, I put thought into every decision, researching what had the best reviews for comfort and functionality, while also balancing  function with form and design. I wanted to bring a little of the out side in, so I used a much more subtle grey, almost blue Pallet. I Then painted the  oak cabinets with the carbonized grey from outside. Additionally I used  western red cedar with the same  Is mahogany flame stain for crown molding. For a focal point, I had a custom mural done on the largest  wall. Its very thought provoking and perfect for the space which by the numbers seems small but with 12 foot high ceilings, makes it feel so much bigger.  I built and installed custom Acacia wood butcher block counter tops, with a Kraus workstation sink That I believe was intended to give a  farmhouse look, but it only lends to this funky design. It has a  built in chopping block and dish drainer. 

The kitchen was stocked with everything that a chef would appreciate. From  beautiful Damascus steel knives, to an Air fryer range that's front controlled and ADA compliant. Coffee and tea lovers? There is a Nespresso Machine that makes the absolute best coffee, stocked with Nespresso's best  coffee offerings as well as from Starbucks and other favorites. . There is a French Press, Bodum Pour over, Krups Noiseless grinder, and several different options for coffee in  fresh bean form in case you wanted to make your travelling companion their first pour over. Double walled glass  cappuccino and espresso mugs, and milk frother.  Individually wrapped tea bags from Twinning's, Taylors of Harrogate, Harford and Sons, and individually wrapped loose leaf tea from all over the world. There is an authentic cast iron Tetsubin  Japanese Tea set that, by the artist, was named after Rikyu (Rentarô Mikuni), a Buddhist priest who believes in the spiritual healing inherent in the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. There’s a Fellow Stagg EKG Digital kettle that’s ranked #1 by baristas and has a beautiful design. The best pour, for your pour-over. And only the best for you. 

Appreciate nice bath towels, or quality sleep? I chose to use  UGG Pacha line Turkish Cotton (and oversized) for all of the bath towels, hand towels, and wash cloths. I  Used UGG for most of the comforters and throws, and there will be several options for the guests when it comes to pillows and sheets, in case you don’t like the crazy high thread count Egyptian cotton ones that will be on the 14 inch hybrid, and fully adjustable bed. Makes it nice if you want to set the head up so you can watch the 75  inch tv,  with amazon prime, local cable, and top it off , a service that gives you every single cable channel from around the world, in different languages, including every single  pay per view event. It also has every single movie that comes out in theaters sometimes while they are still in the theaters. This is a legal service so there are no movies recorded with cellphones. I enjoy high quality Audio but had never bought anything from Klipsch. I wont ever buy anything else again.  You have a Klipsch Three 11 in the flat.   Bose, Sonos, eat your heart out. To sweeten the audio experience, is a fully automatic Audio Technica record player and a nice selection of records from every genre. Just let me know what tickles your fancy and it will be playing for you when you walk through the door. For you business travelers, there is  a wireless printer for your use. 

The lounging furniture are top grain leather , fully reclinable, with adjustable head and footrest, and lumbar also  with built in wireless charging for your phones. I have provided a few reading options including newer books, and a few dating all the way back to the 1850’s. Its really neat to look through them and compare societal differences of then and now and the amazing art done on old school press plates. There are few tastefully chosen board games. A bookcase edition scrabble, and a Luxury Edition Monopoly.  I built  a little area with accompaniments for adult beverages, and a nice Westin orange  juicer, which will always be accompanied by  fresh fruit, in case you would like to get up in the morning and juice some oranges for your “better half”. 

For you adult beverage drinkers there is a nice selection of glass ware. Vintage Paulaner Hefeweizen Glasses, which there are several already in the freezer for you. Huge Bordeaux glasses, glasses for white, lowballs, highballs and if you do partake please let me know in comments when you book that you are ""RED"" or ""WHITE"" and there will be such a thing in the gift basket for you.  

Custom built dining table made from Baltic Beechwood and then a triple coat of epoxy. I built this on an electric, noiseless air frame. You can raise and lower this table from 25 inches all the way up to 48 inches . Feel like standing,  great, sitting, even better. Disabled, I built this for you.  I think I blew ADA Compliant Standards out of the water on This  one. 

Last, but not least. The Bathroom. Continuing the décor, I installed  beautiful stone tile flooring, did the walls in a mute industrial concrete waterproof wallpaper. There is a really cool internally lit vanity mirror with a defogger that does not allow it to  get steamed up. My vision to work with local artists and craftsmen to showcase their work was fulfilled in the floating vanity and sink.  99timbers custom designed and built a live edge undermount and backsplash. It matches the beautiful foil-work sink . This sink is wheelchair accessible. There is a walk-in (or roll-in) modern steam shower. I chose grey stack stone and stunning turquoise subway tile, accentuated again by (a water suitable) choice of wood. Teak Floors and Teak Bench. This shower is 60 inches wide and 36 inches deep. It is wheelchair accessible. There is a 10 inch Kohler rain deluge, 8 body jets and an hand wand. Pressure? got pressure for days!!  Hot water you ask, well , I'm sure someone is going to test out that auto defog mirror. Its definitely a steam shower.  There are Turkish Cotton robes behind the bathroom door in multiple sizes for men and women. There is 3 different levels of toiletries based on the length of your stay. Our standard is  L'occitane Mer & Mistral,  If you're staying 3 nights or more you will receive Aprey Purple Water  (Exclusively used by the Ritz Carlton) if you choose to stay 5 nights or more you will receive  Hermès  eau d' orange vert.  Regardless of which level, you will receive shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and body lotion.  There will also be an individually wrapped bar soap from Marseilles.

The unit is completly ""smart"" enabled. You can control everything with your voice. Lights, thermostat, doorlock, T.V.,  Alarm System, Vacuum cleanet. You can ask to see the doorbell camera and your vehicle on the 8 in screen in the Kitchen.  There is also another 5 inch screen. Both of these have manual camera shutters, and by protocol are never opened by me. If you choose to use them for video calling, you are doing so on your own accord. The only thing in the flat that is not smart controlled are the 2 chandeliers. There is too much wattage going through them. There is Also a hidden safe for your valuables. 

I hope you are ok with smart technology. There  is a virtual concierge that will greet you by name as you come in the front door and ask if you are formally checking in.  You will be given a menu of options, or you can ask exactly what you want. I have spent a great deal of time, programming information Such as info about the property , info on anything inside the flat and how to use it, restaurants, things to do, places to see, family friendly activities, hiking, shopping, etc...I have worked with many local restaurants and stores securing exclusive discount coupons for you, but you have to use the virtual concierge.  I have attached many pictures and videos,  of things in the flat that explain things better. So if you don't know how to make a pour over, it will teach you. 

I'm not going to list every little detail. I can only GUARANTEE you will not find anything like it locally, or for this price.  IF you do ill honor my guarantee and give you a weekend for free.

 I am also trying to set the bar for a different kind of service and go above and beyond. If you choose to book and will be staying at the flat long enough to need groceries, You can place a click list order and I will happily pick them up and have them stocked at the flat for you.  Local grocery store options are Kroger, Walmart, and Food Lion.

My father, myself, and generations in my family served in The United States Military. I am proud, and grateful  in offering a 15% military discount for Active Duty or former service members.  Please let me know before booking so that I can send you  the special offer. I would also ask that you provide some sort of verification.,  ie,  base card, VA ID, or DD214. You would want to think that no one would lie about serving in the military for a discount, but we all know better. This is actually a Federal crime punishable under The Stolen Valor Act of 2013 (revised from 2005).","Enjoy a stylish experience at this centrally-located flat, in the WVU Tech University District.

The condo has electric baseboard heaters in each room, so you can adjust the heat to the temperature that you prefer when it's cold outside. When it's hot, there is an AC unit installed in the living room above the sliding glass door. This is for AC only. We are not allowed to do duct work in the 2nd or 3rd floor condos, so this is the only practical way to get AC in the unit, leaving room doors open as often as possible helps to keep the whole condo cool.
Please be aware there will be a $200 security deposit that will be pre-authorized on your credit card the day before you arrive and is released 7 days after you depart unless there is damage. This is a standard practice for vacation home rentals as there is no staff at the facility and this allows you to check in with an electronic door code and check out by just texting us and leaving the morning of your last day.
Also, the road to the condos is a gravel, hilly, road that Winterplace Ski Resort is paid to take care of it. Sometimes through the year, we will have heavy rains that create ruts in the road and Winterplace Ski Resort, being closed, is slow in making the repairs. Low clearance vehicles will need to be very careful coming up the hill from Winterplace Ski Resort's main parking area. In the winter, they grade the road and keep it plowed and put cinders on the road but please be prepared and understand you may need a four wheel drive, all wheel drive or chains to help get up the hill.
We highly recommend that you purchase travel insurance. Problems can arise in multiple ways and travel insurance can be a low cost guard against losing your money if you have last minute problems and have to cancel. In the past, some of our guests have obtained insurance by going to www.InsureMyTrip.com for details and to purchase. We did call the people at InsuraneMyTrip and they do have plans that will cover for Covid issues but there are several important steps and needs to be done shortly after making your first deposit. The plans are called ""Cancel For Any Reason"" CFAR. Check with your insurance agent before deciding what insurance to purchase. We DO NOT endorse any insurance in particular.

~Long Term Stays ~
For those looking to stay for more than a week, the following changes apply:
- We only allow 3 people to stay per condo
- No pets allowed
- We do not provide daily maid service but will provide clean linens weekly.

NEAR BECKLEY AND WHITEWATER COUNTRY
During the spring, summer and fall don’t think there is nothing to do. We are close to all the fun that southern West Virginia has to offer. Whitewater rafting, kayaking, river tubing, rock climbing, hiking, horseback riding etc. All different kinds of outdoor fun are waiting for you to take advantage of. There are several state and national parks near by, like Little Beaver State Park and Grandview National Park. We are also near Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve. The temperature in the mountains of West Virginia remains cooler than a lot of the surrounding states, so this is great place to come cool off. Enjoy something different from the beach, take your family out into nature.
And for anytime of the year fun, Beckley has something for everyone. Of course, there are all your favorite fast food and sit down restaurants, as well as some home-grown restaurants that might become your new favorites. There is a wide variety of different shops. The Tamarackhas everything you might want to see from our unique West Virginia craftsman. There are a lot of different antique shops and Crossroads Mall for those that might want something a little familiar. There is the Beckley Exhibition Coal Mine, where you can tour an actual coal mine and let the kids explore the coal mining town and the Youth Museum. During good weather, there are also trails, playground, basketball and tennis courts and a pool with a waterslide. There is also, Mountain State Miniature Golfwhich doesn’t have just mini-golf but offers a small coffee shop and an indoor climbing wall.

As native Appalachians, my husband and I have a deep love for this region and its people and the tradition of hospitality.  We are both artists of sorts--I'm a freelance writer/reporter and he is a rock 'n roll keyboard player and works in the local school system. And we manage a herd of dairy goats, mostly LaMancha breed. All with names and personalities. Our place is about 15-20  minutes off off I-77. We're close to the notable ""Back of the Dragon"" motorcycle routes. And very close to some beautiful backroad bicycle routes. The scenery is beautiful all seasons of the year but especially the fall. We hope you'll visit!

 As for the goats, they are ""the greatest entertainers and the greatest time wasters"" as my dad used to say. He was a vet and built the house as a home and office. So it has a sort of historic/museum feel in certain sections. 

We don't guarantee food as part of our Airbnb listing,  but I love to cook and if I'm cooking, you're welcome to join us if you don't have other plans. 

Last but not least, we  love to know a little about our guests beforehand so PLEASE make sure you fill out the ""Describe Yourself"" questions under the Airbnb profile section to speed along the booking process.

Hot water radiator heat keeps the room warm in the winter and concrete floors keep it comfortably cool in the summer. There's access to a full bath with tub and shower but you must walk up a flight of stairs. I also try to keep the house as free from allergens/fragrances as possible for guests who have sensitivities (noted in House Rules below).

The wi-fi is very poor in the bedroom but great in the parlor room just down the hall.

I'm in and out of the spaces with shared access but your bed and bath are always private. I like to socialize and interact with guests but I'm also happy to leave you to your own privacy.

There's a great little biking road about 1/4 mile from my home that lots of bikers love to ride. About 5 miles away is a great mountain bike trail at the Blfd WV city park. For more serious bikers, there's the Burkes Garden trail. 
For hikers, Lincolnshire Park, about 13 miles away in Tazewell, has features so beautiful you will think you're in the The Hobbit's  ""Shire."" 
For other things to do and places to eat, see my Guidebook section of Guest Resources.

The Town of Bluefield, Va. operates Graham Transit. Graham Transit runs three deviated fixed routes throughout the area each day. I am a 5 minute walk from the closest bus route stop.  Bus route schedules are listed on the Town of Bluefield, Va. official website.

It sits on the south side of Iron Mountain in the Jefferson National Forest’s Mount Rogers National Recreation Area and takes in the scenic views of Whitetop Mountain and Mount Rogers. Its proximity to sites and towns of middle Appalachia, along with its fresh water, fresh air and relaxed pace make our cabin a lovely spot to visit.

Dongola Cabin is ten miles south of Interstate-81 and the town of Chilhowie, Virginia. Atlanta, Charlotte, Roanoke, Richmond, Knoxville, and Washington DC are each between two and six hours drive. Our accommodation includes high speed internet, full kitchen and laundry facilities.  Please note, the nightly rate includes a 5% occupancy tax for Smyth County.  

**We aim to make the cabin as safe as possible for your visiting pleasure.  We disinfect the cabin after each guest and we do not allow back-to-back bookings in order to decrease the possibility of community transmission.**

Guests will have access to the entire cabin (excepting a crawl space) and land around the cabin. It also has landline for domestic calls and emergencies.

We are available by telephone/email/text message for any guests queries or emergencies.

Nearby, several trail heads intersect, including the well-known Appalachian and Virginia Creeper Trails (others include the Iron Mountain Trail, the Skulls Gap Trail, the Buzzard Rock Trail, the Bear Tree Gap Trail, the Straight Mountain Trail, the Straight Branch Trail, and the Pine Mountain Trail). Hundreds of wild blueberry bushes yield end-of-summer fruit on Whitetop and Pine Mountains. Steep mountain valleys and hollows display the colors of Spring and Autumn foliage. The Whitetop Laurel Creek, a notable wild trout stream, stretches for twelve miles down the valley floor and provides year-round fishing as well as five miles of fully accessible recreation facilities with wildlife viewing platforms in the Creek Junction area.

Scenic and historic routes surround Dongola Cabin, including the famous Route 58 ('The Crooked Road'), Grayson Highlands State Park and Parkway, the balds at Elk Garden, and the highest elevated road in Virginia towards the peak of Whitetop Mountain. From Dongola Cabin, outdoor enthusiasts can rent bicycles and lazily (or not) ride 15 miles down the Virginia Creeper Trail to the town of Damascus, take a daylong horseback ride into Pine Mountain and Mount Rogers, or just take in the vista from Dongola Cabin's spacious front porch and vintage gliding swing.

The nearest grocery store is about 30 minutes away in Chilhowie. The cabin will have basic pantry items and a few provisions for emergencies, but guests should be sure to shop for groceries before their arrival. Also, check out: the Konnarock Store and the Whitetop Store which are nearby; the Barter Theatre, and Bella's Pizza in Abingdon; the Damascus Brewery in Damascus.","We appreciate that the cabin is left in the condition it was found aside from general cleaning, and laundry.","We are available by telephone/email/text message for any guests queries or emergencies.","en","English","Great mountain view!

Entrance access is private to guest through the front. Guest environment includes the spacious bedroom, private bath which extends to the Adirondack chairs in the front yard which are a great place to put your feet up with a good book.

We are there for our guest in every way.  
Please feel free to contact me via text or phone for any questions for needs that you may have. The caretaker is also available by phone only.

*We are conveniently located to exits 17, 14, and 13 of interstate 81. 

*Main Street Abingdon is a 5-7 minute drive. Creeper trail starts there.  

*The Holston lake boat ramp is about 7 minutes away.  

*Bristol is a quick 12 minutes.

Our neighborhood is a fresh, peaceful and quiet environment. Friendly but loosely populated where  nature abounds. Most mornings you awaken to birds singing and interacting with one another. As an avid birder, I can hear the sounds of golden finches, siskins, chickadee, crows, geese, jays, cardinals just to name a few in throughout the day. While you are welcome to enjoy the front yard and witness beautiful sunrises, sunsets, bunnies scampering and occasionally deer running, it’s a wonderful place to recharge your batteries and regain your balance.

Car or horse is the best transportation unless you can ride a bike up and down the mountains well. Strong legs recommended....

EXTRA attention for sanitizing is crucial. It is imperative these days to promote a safe and germ free environment. We strive for a germ free home. Hand sanitizer, gloves and Lysol are available. 

Bedrooms and bathrooms are thoroughly cleaned and sanitized with antibacterial products. All sheets and towels are sanitized in hot water and antibacterials. 

Our goal is to promote a comfortable germ free environment for your safety and ultimate relaxation.

To maintain a cleaner and healthy indoor environment; please leave your shoes at the shoe tray  inside near the front door.
House shoes are required to ensure a more germ free environment and your comfort. Also please wear mask in the common areas.

Our home is about positivity and comfort.  Come unwind relax and enjoy all that Abingdon has to offer.","- Quite hours after 10pm","We are there for our guest in every way.

Sit under the stars by night and under the magnificent canopy of shade trees by day.                          

Clinch Mountain is home to beautiful plant life and undergrowth, while a variety of deciduous trees form a towering canopy above.

It is truly a birdwatcher and botanist paradise.

Location is right on the trail leading to the Channel’s and is the last privately owned parcel upon entering channels state forest and natural preserve.

The great Channels are a series of deep sandstone crevices worn into sandstone outcrops on the mountains summit and form one of Virginia’s most fascinating ecosystems. It is possible to easily walk within the maze-like channels , which harbor an almost cave-like microclimate .Coupled with outstanding views from the top of these outcrops and a fire tower on Middle Knob’s summit ,this hike forms one of southwest Virginia’s most scenic and popular hiking destinations.

The hike is a hidden gem in southwest Virginia and you will find nothing else in Virginia quite like it . For the more adventurous hiker, the hike can continue on to Hidden Valley Lake ( 14 mile hike).

The road that leads to the cabin is off of the route 80 trailhead at the Russell / Washington county line. The gravel road leading to the cabin is shared with the hiking trail leading to the channels.

Step right outside of the front door at The Channels Retreat and you will be greeted by the trail's most heavily used 3 miles that travel to the Great Channels of Virginia. 

The Channels are a series of deep sandstone crevices worn into sandstone outcrops on the mountain's summit and form one of Virginia's most fascinating ecosystems. 

It is possible to easily walk within the maze-like channels, which harbor an almost cave-like microclimate and often hold snow cover long after temperatures have risen above freezing. Coupled with outstanding views from the top of these outcrops and a fire tower on Middle Knob's summit, this hike forms one of southwest Virginia's most scenic and popular hiking destinations.

The private bathroom is located across the hall with tub/shower with heated floors and fully equipped with towels, soap and hairdryer etc.  Feel free to enjoy our front porch.

The paved driveway is in the back of the house off of Madison Street and is steep. If you bring your bicycles, we have space to store them.  We also host long distance bicycle riders through a site called Warmshowers.  If we happen to have a biker, they will downstairs. There is an active train a block from our house.

Living room, kitchen (welcome to use the frig) and the front porch.  This is a shared space with a shared entrance.

We are happy to interact with our guests but also respect you’re privacy.

We are in an older neighborhood in Abingdon that is going through gentrification.  The Barter Theatre is about a 15 minute walk (.06 Mi.) and Wolf Hills Brewery is about a 15 minute walk (.07 Mi.) from our home.  There is an active train  2 blocks from our house.

It is easy to walk downtown, to local restaurants and to the Virginia Creeper Trail.  There is a bicycle shop/shuttle a few blocks away.

The area is safe so I will leave the door open and the key on the table. There is no protocol for checking in, so you may access the space when you arrive. Parking is in front of the steps leading up to the space. Please don't park in front of garage doors. Thanks so much.

We are always available to our guests to answer questions about the area or to resolve any issues that might occur with the space. You will be provided with our cell and house phone numbers in the event that you need anything, otherwise you will have total privacy.

Quite neighborhood with two miles of walking trails, through the woods, on our property.
In St. Paul, Va. just about 7 miles away is the Sugar Hills ATV and hiking trails, and the newly remodeled ""Western Front"" with a nice Restaurant. Sugar Hill Brewery is also a great place to eat and experience local beer. 
The Hidden Valley Lake Area offers hiking, boating and fishing, and is just a few miles away. Fifteen- twenty miles away is The Channels, a majestic sandstone formation that is over 400-million years old. Great Hike !  The ""Devils Bath Tub"" is not to far away and a must see. The Pinnacle Natural Area Reserve is also very close and quite spectacular. The town of Abingdon (18 miles away) is a great little town with some excellent restaurants,  Wolf Hills Brewing Company, The Creeper Trail, The Barter Theater (state theater of Virginia!), biking and walking trails, festivals, and much more.

Please check location of the property before booking. 
Thanks

2. No overnight guests other than those registered and approved when making the reservation online. If you are expecting visitors for a short period of time during your stay, please let your hosts know.
3. No pets are permitted without prior permission and with an additional pet charge of $25 per pet (maximum one large dog or two small dogs). Sorry, no cats are permitted ever. We have four (friendly) dogs so we will need to coordinate yard usage to avoid any possible problems. Please clean up after your pet! Pets may not be left unattended for more than 2 hours and must be in a kennel/travel carrier. If you need assistance finding a dog-sitter please contact your hosts ahead of time.
4. Trash cans and bags are provided in the Loft (under the sink in the kitchen and bathroom). If the cans get full during your stay, please take the trash out and put in one of the trash cans in, or by, the driveway. No need to take out the trash at the end of your stay.
5. No hair dying or coloring is permitted in the Loft.
6. We do not have child safety features; children are welcome if you accept liability and are comfortable knowing we have no child proofing along with many stairs.
7. Minors under the age of 18 must be accompanied, in person AT ALL TIMES, by an adult over 21. You must be 21 to book a reservation at the Loft.
8. The antler hooks by the door will not hold heavy loads. Please only hang light jackets and clothing on them.
9. Please clean your boots/shoes as well as you can before entering the building and use the boot tray upstairs by the door for your boots and shoes.
10. Please do not block neighbor’s driveways, including the apartment’s next door. We will do what we can to help you with parking (including our driveway and street parking in front of our house). Please let us know if you’re traveling with a trailer so we can help you plan for parking.
11. If you would like to sit outside, you are welcome to use the camp chairs at the bottom of the stairs. If it is raining or too sunny, feel free to sit under the carport by the house. If we are parked there, just send us a message during daytime hours (9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) and we’ll move our car: we want you to enjoy your stay! You can also sit in the backyard but be aware that our dogs will occasionally need to be let out. If you are using the yard and/or grill, we will check with you before letting out the dogs. When sitting outside after 9 p.m. please try to keep the noise down so as not to disturb the residents and neighbors.
12. Do not go out on the roof. While it looks like a great place to hang out, it’s not safe for people and walking on the shingles are likely to cause damage.
13. Without exception, no smoking, vaping or marijuana usage inside the Loft. Please don’t think it can be covered up, it cannot. We have to extensively clean to remove the contaminant before other guests can arrive. Neutralizing this contaminant inside requires a $100 minimum service fee. Feel free to step outside in the back yard and quietly enjoy a tobacco smoke or vape; you'll just need to police your butts.
14. Before you leave, please wash any dishes that you used. Clean dishes can be left in the drainer to dry and we’ll put them away.
15. No need to strip the bed or pile up used towels and washcloths upon departure but during your stay, please hang wet towels and washcloths on the towel racks, shower curtain rod or side of the bathtub.
16. Please lock the door at the bottom of the steps whenever you leave the premises, including your departure.

The Foggy Mountain Loft has the feel of a mountain hideaway but in town, close to where you want to play & eat. There's a private entrance to this simple guest loft above the garage behind our home. You'll find a basic kitchenette, full bathroom, Roku TV and WiFi. At over 50 years old, the Loft shows its age with multiple layers of paint and years of cosmetic repairs, but it has been recently renovated to create a safe, clean & comfortable space.

The Foggy Mountain Loft is a single L-shaped room which has a double bed, futon couch, and a full bathroom with bathtub and shower. You can use our Adirondack chairs to spend time outside or stay in and watch your streaming apps on the Roku TV. There isn't a stove or oven in the Loft but there is a microwave, coffee maker, hot water kettle, toaster, air fryer and electric skillet for simple food preparation, and a grill in the garage you can use upon request.  There are also many great restaurants in Logan just a few minutes away.

Foggy Mountain Loft is on a residential street near town with free on-street parking. If you're towing a trailer, we'll try to save the spaces in front of the house for you with prior arrangement or you can use our driveway. You'll have a private entrance to the Loft at the end of the driveway with access through a digital keypad deadbolt lock.

We're available during your stay for assistance or to answer questions but you'll have as much privacy as you're looking for.

There are many places to eat in Logan and a lot of things to do:

Chief Logan State Park: 5.6 miles
Chief Logan Recreation Center: 8.2 miles
Dunks Body Shop (Gym): 12.5 miles
H & M Bearwallow Trail connector: 1 mile
H & M Bearwallow Trailhead: 4.1 miles
H & M Rockhouse Trailhead: 13.8 miles
H & M Buffalo Mountain Trailhead: 28 miles
H & M Devil Anse Trailhead: 34.6 miles

Gas station (which usually has the cheapest gas in Logan) is just about a mile away (just past the coffee house and bakery...)!

On street parking is easy to find near Foggy Mountain Loft. If you're raveling with a trailer you'll be able to find a spot within a couple blocks of the Loft. With prior arrangement, guests traveling with a trailer can have the parking spaces in front of  our house saved by us until their arrival or can park in the driveway (pulling truck into carport, there's room for a trailer with one ATV).

This is a 2nd floor loft with a narrow staircase, so you'll need to keep an eye on small children and keep in mind your own ability to climb stairs.","1. No parties or events may be held at the Loft or on the property. 
2. No overnight guests other than those registered and approved when making the reservation online. If you are expecting visitors for a short period of time during your stay, please let your hosts know.
3. No pets are permitted without prior permission and with an additional pet charge of $25 per pet (maximum one large dog or two small dogs). Sorry, no cats are permitted ever. We have four (friendly) dogs so we will need to coordinate yard usage to avoid any possible problems. Please clean up after your pet! Pets may not be left unattended for more than 2 hours and must be in a kennel/travel carrier. If you need assistance finding a dog-sitter please contact your hosts ahead of time.
4. Trash cans and bags are provided in the Loft (under the sink in the kitchen and bathroom). If the cans get full during your stay, please take the trash out and put in one of the trash cans in, or by, the driveway. No need to take out the trash at the end of your stay.
5. No hair dying or coloring is permitted in the Loft.
6. We do not have child safety features; children are welcome if you accept liability and are comfortable knowing we have no child proofing along with many stairs.
7. Minors under the age of 18 must be accompanied, in person AT ALL TIMES, by an adult over 21. You must be 21 to book a reservation at the Loft.
8. The antler hooks by the door will not hold heavy loads. Please only hang light jackets and clothing on them.
9. Please clean your boots/shoes as well as you can before entering the building and use the boot tray upstairs by the door for your boots and shoes.
10. Please do not block neighbor’s driveways, including the apartment’s next door. We will do what we can to help you with parking (including our driveway and street parking in front of our house). Please let us know if you’re traveling with a trailer so we can help you plan for parking.
11. If you would like to sit outside, you are welcome to use the camp chairs at the bottom of the stairs. If it is raining or too sunny, feel free to sit under the carport by the house. If we are parked there, just send us a message during daytime hours (9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) and we’ll move our car: we want you to enjoy your stay! You can also sit in the backyard but be aware that our dogs will occasionally need to be let out. If you are using the yard and/or grill, we will check with you before letting out the dogs. When sitting outside after 9 p.m. please try to keep the noise down so as not to disturb the residents and neighbors.
12. Do not go out on the roof. While it looks like a great place to hang out, it’s not safe for people and walking on the shingles are likely to cause damage.
13. Without exception, no smoking, vaping or marijuana usage inside the Loft. Please don’t think it can be covered up, it cannot. We have to extensively clean to remove the contaminant before other guests can arrive. Neutralizing this contaminant inside requires a $100 minimum service fee. Feel free to step outside in the back yard and quietly enjoy a tobacco smoke or vape; you'll just need to police your butts.
14. Before you leave, please wash any dishes that you used. Clean dishes can be left in the drainer to dry and we’ll put them away.
15. No need to strip the bed or pile up used towels and washcloths upon departure but during your stay, please hang wet towels and washcloths on the towel racks, shower curtain rod or side of the bathtub.
16. Please lock the door at the bottom of the steps whenever you leave the premises, including your departure.","We're available during your stay for assistance or to answer questions but you'll have as much privacy as you're looking for.","en","English","Foggy Mountain Loft near Hatfield & McCoy Trails","There are many places to eat in Logan and a lot of things to do:

We value the learning and personal growth that come with travel, and love sharing our experiences with others. That's why my husband and I decided to create Escape Vacation Rentals, where we can share our personal spaces with others from all over. We believe that travel has the power to broaden our horizons and connect us with people and places we might never have encountered otherwise. We hope you enjoy our little spaces as much as we do!!!

summer's heat in this rustic log cabin and enjoy its modern amenities and dramatic views Situated close to Jefferson National Forest with its hiking trails, New River Campground for canoeing or tubing, Grayson Highlands State Park and the VA Creeper Bike Trail, the cabin provides a base for scenic trips to numerous festivals, antique shops and outdoor recreational opportunities. Alternatively, you can rock on the front porch and absorb the ever-changing and spectacular views.

The log cabin features a 2-story vaulted ceiling, dramatic fireplace and rough-hewn plank walls and ceiling in the living room. Local vintage antiques decorate the living room walls.

The cabin sleeps 10, but there are 2 extra bunks and a pull-out couch if needed.

Surrounded by pine forests and fields, you might see some deer and wild turkeys and hear owls. You are guaranteed to hear a chorus of birds and the swish of the wind through pine trees in the morning. Bring your hiking shoes and some good books to enjoy in this tranquil, beautiful setting.

Temperatures at the cabin's 4,000 feet elevation are typically about 10 degrees cooler than in lower-elevation Independence, VA, just 8 miles away. And Independence typically has 10-degree lower temperatures than lower-elevation Piedmont locations such as Charlotte, NC, some 124 miles to the south. Independence has a large grocery store, restaurants, park with swimming pool and tennis courts, and antiqueing if you decide to go exploring.

The whole property is available to you other than an owners shed and closet which are kept locked.

We're available to help you 24/7 although we are not local. Who to call in various cases is in the FAQ we send once you have been confirmed as a booking

Our guests are best at describing the experience:

•	The cabin is special. It’s located in a beautiful area of Virginia that provides solitude in nature while also being 15 minutes from a nice grocery store. We appreciated the well-stocked kitchen with nice cookware and kitchen tools. We spent a day on the property enjoying the view, walking through the fields to find even more splendid views, and having a cozy fire in the comfortable cabin. The next two days we rode the Virginia Creeper trail and hiked with wild ponies in Grayson Highlands State Park. Anne was responsive to all inquiries and provided all the information we needed for our trip. - April 2022
•	100 percent awesomeness!!! We loved the cabin and property kitchen was well supplied. Being from Florida we had a beautiful fire burning almost all week. Great family time. We hope to return one day - April 2021
•	Views are unreal as are the chipmunks, dear, cows, turkeys, hawks and many, many rabbits. The weather was amazing, no bugs or skeeter's.  Who would think you would need a fire in July. - July 2020
•	What a beautiful and peaceful property it was so relaxing and the children loved taking walks, swinging on the tire swing, running around in the yard, sitting on the big rock, making some wars at night and exploring the Woods thank you for sharing.
•	What amazing views, the fresh mountain air and the picturesque cabin were the perfect escape for our family.  Our kids’ favorite part was the tire swing and we all enjoyed fires in the fireplace and in the fire pit.

Frequently Asked Questions
Q. Anything I need to do to “open” the cabin?
A. 
Air Conditioning: Just open all the windows.
Extra Freezer and Refrigerators: There is 1 short, white freezer and 1 short, white refrigerator on the back porch.
Lawn Swing: Cushions for the front porch swing, chairs and the lawn swing are stored inside a closet in the bedroom closest to the bathroom on the first floor. They can be placed on the swing for your use and in the shed’s overhang to keep dry at other times. The canopy for the lawn swing is under the shed’s overhang if you wish to attach it.
Heat: The thermostat is on the LR wall between the two bedroom doors. If heat is needed, the fuel oil furnace should be used as the primary heating source, as it is much less costly to operate. If electric baseboard heat is needed, individual thermostats are on each electric baseboard heater. If you run out of firewood or if you think the next renter might run out, please let us know.

Q. Anything I need to do while there?
A. Just a couple of items:
-Most importantly, keep the gate to the adjacent property (the one you can see from the house) chained shut, so that any cows grazing in the adjacent field (which is not part of Big Ridge Retreat) will not get out.
-Let us know about things that need fixing, cleaning, don’t work or if you see any evidence of mice or bears. We are not local and need your help in a little quality control.
-Mainly, just relax and enjoy your visit!!!
Q. What about cell phone service at the house?
A. It is marginal to non-existent inside the cabin (at least for AT&T and Verizon). Sometimes you can get some service with Verizon if you stand on the big rock in the front yard. Verizon customers also usually get service down the hill and in nearby Independence, VA.
Q. What about long-distance calls on the cabin’s land line?
A. Local and US long distance calls are free. You are responsible for international calls.
Q. What about Internet service at the cabin?
A. It is there through a dish. The security code is on the router which is on top of the refrigerator.
Q. What about TV service at the cabin?
A. There is a TV in the cabin for use in conjunction with the DVD player. There is no cable service and no TV antenna, so hard to get any channels. There are plenty of games and puzzles to play; many books to read; spectacular stars to watch; and a cozy fireplace for night-time amusement. During the day there is plenty of natural beauty and nature to enjoy while away from the hubbub.
Q. Are there CD’s or DVD’s at the cabin?
A. There are a few CD’s and DVD’s. You may wish to bring a few of your own favorites.
Q. What about hunting on the property or on adjacent properties?
A. Neither hunting nor a gun is permitted on the Big Ridge Retreat property. We believe that all of the adjacent properties are posted for no hunting as well.
Q. What do I need to do when I check out?
A. Just a few simple steps, which should also be posted in the cabin:
1. Please place all trash and recyclables in their respective containers by the shed. Trash should be in tied plastic bags. Secure bungee straps on top of trash containers to keep animals out. Housekeeping will remove the trash.
2. Put your dirty dishes in the dishwasher and run them.
3. Empty and unplug freezer on back porch.
4. Leave towels on the floor and sheets on beds and don’t make up the beds, so we know which ones you used.
5. Please close and lock all windows and doors and close blinds
a. Make sure to slide bolts on kitchen door, back door and upstairs door
b. Latch screen doors on upstairs balcony, back porch and kitchen so they don’t slam against the
6. Leave thermostat on 50 to avoid freezing pipes.
7. As you leave the property, close and lock the gate. Leave the 2 keys in the lockbox by the front gate and rotate the lock combination wheels. Leave the keys to the back decks on the nail at the end of the mantle, where you found them.","- Not wheelchair accessible

Q. Anything I need to do to “open” the cabin?
A. 
Air Conditioning: Just open all the windows.
Extra Freezer and Refrigerators: There is 1 short, white freezer and 1 short, white refrigerator on the back porch.
Lawn Swing: Cushions for the front porch swing, chairs and the lawn swing are stored inside a closet in the bedroom closest to the bathroom on the first floor. They can be placed on the swing for your use and in the shed’s overhang to keep dry at other times. The canopy for the lawn swing is under the shed’s overhang if you wish to attach it.
Heat: The thermostat is on the LR wall between the two bedroom doors. If heat is needed, the fuel oil furnace should be used as the primary heating source, as it is much less costly to operate. If electric baseboard heat is needed, individual thermostats are on each electric baseboard heater. If you run out of firewood or if you think the next renter might run out, please let us know.

Q. Anything I need to do while there?
A. Just a couple of items:
-Most importantly, keep the gate to the adjacent property (the one you can see from the house) chained shut, so that any cows grazing in the adjacent field (which is not part of Big Ridge Retreat) will not get out.
-Let us know about things that need fixing, cleaning, don’t work or if you see any evidence of mice or bears. We are not local and need your help in a little quality control.
-Mainly, just relax and enjoy your visit!!!
Q. What about cell phone service at the house?
A. It is marginal to non-existent inside the cabin (at least for AT&T and Verizon). Sometimes you can get some service with Verizon if you stand on the big rock in the front yard. Verizon customers also usually get service down the hill and in nearby Independence, VA.
Q. What about long-distance calls on the cabin’s land line?
A. Local and US long distance calls are free. You are responsible for international calls.
Q. What about Internet service at the cabin?
A. It is there through a dish. The security code is on the router which is on top of the refrigerator.
Q. What about TV service at the cabin?
A. There is a TV in the cabin for use in conjunction with the DVD player. There is no cable service and no TV antenna, so hard to get any channels. There are plenty of games and puzzles to play; many books to read; spectacular stars to watch; and a cozy fireplace for night-time amusement. During the day there is plenty of natural beauty and nature to enjoy while away from the hubbub.
Q. Are there CD’s or DVD’s at the cabin?
A. There are a few CD’s and DVD’s. You may wish to bring a few of your own favorites.
Q. What about hunting on the property or on adjacent properties?
A. Neither hunting nor a gun is permitted on the Big Ridge Retreat property. We believe that all of the adjacent properties are posted for no hunting as well.
Q. What do I need to do when I check out?
A. Just a few simple steps, which should also be posted in the cabin:
1. Please place all trash and recyclables in their respective containers by the shed. Trash should be in tied plastic bags. Secure bungee straps on top of trash containers to keep animals out. Housekeeping will remove the trash.
2. Put your dirty dishes in the dishwasher and run them.
3. Empty and unplug freezer on back porch.
4. Leave towels on the floor and sheets on beds and don’t make up the beds, so we know which ones you used.
5. Please close and lock all windows and doors and close blinds
a. Make sure to slide bolts on kitchen door, back door and upstairs door
b. Latch screen doors on upstairs balcony, back porch and kitchen so they don’t slam against the
6. Leave thermostat on 50 to avoid freezing pipes.
7. As you leave the property, close and lock the gate. Leave the 2 keys in the lockbox by the front gate and rotate the lock combination wheels. Leave the keys to the back decks on the nail at the end of the mantle, where you found them.","The log cabin features a 2-story vaulted ceiling, dramatic fireplace and rough-hewn plank walls and ceiling in the living room. Local vintage antiques decorate the living room walls.

The cabin sleeps 10, but there are 2 extra bunks and a pull-out couch if needed.

Surrounded by pine forests and fields, you might see some deer and wild turkeys and hear owls. You are guaranteed to hear a chorus of birds and the swish of the wind through pine trees in the morning. Bring your hiking shoes and some good books to enjoy in this tranquil, beautiful setting.

Temperatures at the cabin's 4,000 feet elevation are typically about 10 degrees cooler than in lower-elevation Independence, VA, just 8 miles away. And Independence typically has 10-degree lower temperatures than lower-elevation Piedmont locations such as Charlotte, NC, some 124 miles to the south. Independence has a large grocery store, restaurants, park with swimming pool and tennis courts, and antiqueing if you decide to go exploring.","Escape summer's heat in this rustic log cabin and enjoy its modern amenities and dramatic views Situated close to Jefferson National Forest with its hiking trails, New River Campground for canoeing or tubing, Grayson Highlands State Park and the VA Creeper Bike Trail, the cabin provides a base for scenic trips to numerous festivals, antique shops and outdoor recreational opportunities. Alternatively, you can rock on the front porch and absorb the ever-changing and spectacular views.","There is no public transit and we recommend a standard size sedan or larger, preferably with 4 wheel drive as the driveway is quite steep.","45","77",,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_bathroom","","Bathroom","33","34","40","44","46","85",,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_bedroom_laundry","","Bedroom and laundry","1",,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_entertainment","","Entertainment","27","30",,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_heating_cooling","","Heating and cooling","35","36","37","39",,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_home_safety","","Home safety","4",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_internet_office","","Internet and office","8","89","90","91","93","94","95","96","236","672",,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_kitchen_dining","","Kitchen and dining","99","100","101","179","219","280",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_outdoor","","Outdoor","9",,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_parking_facilities","","Parking and facilities","5",,,,,,,"pdp_unavailable","","Not included",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"false","5","VA","0","https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14088218"

Located in a gated community called Cove Creek which consists of many  large acre properties and very little development.  Several trails located directly on the property for atv riding and hiking.  The community is atv friendly and also boasts a beautiful creek containing brook trout and picturesque waterfall.  Winterplace , Hatfield Mccoy Trails, and Appalachian trail all only minutes away.

There are many things that make this cabin unique.  First, it's  a  1,200 sq foot 3 bedroom fully equipped cozy cabin property on 18 acres and has breathtaking mountaintop views and private access to our own trails for hiking and ATV'ing.  It's also centrally located to several well known mountain adventure places for White water rafting, Skiiing, ATV'ing, Hiking, and much more.  We moderately priced this so that families, couples, and friend groups alike can take advantage of it.  We have wood logs on the property for the fireplace that can be chopped and usually there is some already there.  While you feel like your in complete solitude at the top of the south side it's nice to know you have easy access to many amenities (grocery stores, restaurants, movie theater, etc) in the city of Bluefield, VA: located just minutes from the bottom of the northside of the mountain.

You have access to the whole cabin and the trails on the property as well as the trail that goes to my brothers property that can be hiked or used by ATV's.  You also have access to the private community waterfall.

We are in florida but have a property manager that is there for housing needs and/or emergencies.  I pride myself of communication and maximizing your experience.  Email or text me for any details anytime.

The cabin is located inside of a gated, sparsely populated community called cove creek.  Guests have access to the Creek which has trout and a beautiful waterfall.  The city of bluefield and Tazewell are mintues away and have many restaurants, grociery stores, and your basic amenities (there's a walmart...lol).  Also within driving distance are great adventure places like the Hatfield Mccoy ATV Trails, Appalachian Trail for hiking, Winter Place ski resort,  AceRaft for white water and many  parks with waterfalls like pipestem and the cascades.  The property itself is 18 acres and has several trails on it for hiking and atv'ing.

If it’s not snowing any car can be used to get up and down the mountain.  However if more then 2-4 inches snow is in the forecast we highly recommend 4 wheel drive.  Also, the driveway can be tough to get up and down if you aren’t use to driving in the mountains.  I can do it in a Prius as long as it’s not snowing but I have experience. Biggest hint is stick to the left side when going up. There is additional parking at the coldesac on top of the driveway if you want to play it safe

*It takes about 15-20 minutes to go up or down the mountain depending on your vehicle, what your towing, and comfortableness in mountain driving.  
*Hatfielld Mccoy trails are about 15-45 minutes from the bottom depending on which trailhead you access.  as of right now you can not access directly by ATV.
*WinterPlace is 39 miles from the bottom of the mountain and takes about 30 minutes.
*5 miles from Appalachian Trail and can actually view the mountain ridge it passes through from the cabin. 
*""The Back og the Dragon"" Trail for motorcycles is close but might have to trailer bikes down the mountain depending if you can ride on the gravel roads.","-you're expected to leave the cabin in clean condition and all trash in bags and dishes washed.  Cleaning lady is not responsible for cleaning up messes, bottles, and other trash left throughout the house and reviews will be given accordingly.
- Special consideration can be given for pets.  Message me individually 
- Accompany children at all times.
- You can smoke outside but please avoid throwing butt's on ground.
- be careful in dry seasons of fires outside.   Put any fire outside completely out with water.   Winds are strong at the top of mountain and can restart your fires that aren’t fully out out and blow embers into dry leaves.   
-  no hunting unless otherwise permitted by owner and properly licensed.
-  no chopping down of live trees or chopping into damaging move trees.   
- lastly, Don't be an idiot.","We are in florida but have a property manager that is there for housing needs and/or emergencies.  I pride myself of communication and maximizing your experience.

Spearhead Trails Coal Canyon Trail! This cabin is quiet and perfect for nature lovers and riders with quick access to shopping and local restaurants. Sit on the porch and cookout with the outdoor grill and picnic table on property. This property offers privacy and security for your family as well as your vehicles & UTV's. Not only is it perfect for UTV enthusiasts but families as well!

We typically let guests do self check in, sometimes my husband does like to meet the guests if he’s available when they arrive. We are here should any issues occur.

The cabin is close to the town but still secluded, a 24 hour gas station and restaurants are very close by.

The driveway is steep, any guest with a trailer will need a 4 wheel drive. Any large trailer will need to park on the flat right below the driveway. A 4wd is typically preferred but many cars have made it with no trouble. During the winter months of snow/ice should be present, access to the cabin could be difficult but parking and walking up is an option that others have done. We just like to make guests aware before arrival so they use their judgement.","See Rental Agreement for further info","We typically let guests do self check in, sometimes my husband does like to meet the guests if he’s available when they arrive.

The cabin on Coney Island, a Guest House property, offers you both!!

The Cabin on Coney Island is one of the properties of The Guest House Inn on Courthouse Square. The cabin offers all amenities on the seclusion of an island.  When you really want to get away from it all, visit the cabin on Coney Island. The island is located at the confluence of the New and Greenbrier Rivers and accessible by watercraft only.

The entire island is there for you to explore!

We are available to help throughout the stay but will not be in person on the island.

A one time bustling railroad community is now a charming downtown with brick lined streets, eclectic shops, and old architecture all nestled along the banks of the New and Greenbrier rivers.  
The confluence of the Bluestone, New, and Greenbrier rivers form the southern West Virginia gateway of the mighty New River in  Summers County.  Outdoor recreational adventure abounds in and around Hinton.  Summers County is one of only a few counties in West Virginia that offers kayakers, floaters, and fisherman 16 public access sites along the banks of the Greenbrier and the New.  
With the combination of natural beauty and historic charm, Hinton is the hidden jewel of Summers County.

This is a true island!  The Cabin on Coney Island is located at the confluence of the Greenbrier and New Rivers. A watercraft is the only way to access the island. Don't have a boat? A local outfitter company, Cantrell's Ultimate Rafting can provide a quick trip to Coney Island.
There are logistics involved with getting to and from the island.  The logistics will differ depending upon if you have your own kayaks or if you are using Cantrell's.  
If you are interested in staying at the island and leaving daily, it can be challenging.  Cantrell's charges a fee each way for shuttle service and may not be available at the times needed.  If customers want to explore the area and do not have their own watercraft and shuttles necessary, we encourage you to consider our other properties in the Hinton Historic District.

The island is a true island at the confluence of the New River and Greenbrier River.  We only have a well-system for water at the cabin.  While the water is safe to drink and shower in, it does have a sulfur smell.  We do provide drinking water for guests.  
A stay on the island is a rustic adventure.  
We clean, sanitize, landscape, clean the beach, weed-eat the path, knock down cobwebs, cut firewood, etc between every guest.  There are things outside of our control such as mosquitos and occasional debris that comes from raising and lowering water levels.  
We do our best to make sure you have an amazing stay !!","Smoking inside the Cabin will result in a $250 charge for cleaning. 
A $295.00 reservation fee plus applicable sales tax is required to secure lodging.  This is a non-refundable reservation deposit. We reserve the right to cancel any reservation to the Cabin on Coney Island due to weather conditions.
A no-show will be charged for the entire reserved stay.  
You must have your own transportation on and off the island via boat, kayak or canoe. We partner with a local company to help secure transportation to and from the island at an additional cost.","We are available to help throughout the stay but will not be in person on the island.","en","English","Private Island and Cabin - Hinton, WV - Natl Park","A one time bustling railroad community is now a charming downtown with brick lined streets, eclectic shops, and old architecture all nestled along the banks of the New and Greenbrier rivers.

The cabin is located on a working family farm. You can purchase beef, pork, and chicken to cook while you’re here or bring a cooler and take some home.

Take a break from life. Get away. Come relax in solitude or with your spouse. Reconnect with nature. Breathe in that fresh air. Observe wildlife and get a taste of life on the farm.

The cabin completely private, but if you’d like to visit with family or friends there is another cabin located on the farm too. Check out our other listing for Valley View Cabin. You cannot see the other cabin, but it is located a couple hundred yards away.

We are available by phone (call or text) if you need anything.  We can offer suggestions of things to do while here (folder of information in the cabin). If we’re around we’d be happy to show you around the farm.

We are about a mile off of Hwy 16 (Back of the Dragon). About 10 miles from Hungry Mother State Park (hiking, fishing, beach swimming area...). We’re 25 minutes from Marion where there is an adorable Main Street with shops and eateries.  We are about 45 minutes from Abingdon (Barter Theatre, antique shopping, dining, winery...).

We are not near any public transportation.

We are about 25 minutes away from town. So, you may want to plan to stop at the grocery store on your way in. There are plenty of great restaurants in Marion. (We have a list of restaurants and activities to do while here.) FYI: Many of the Marion shops/restaurants are CLOSED on Mondays!

On our farm we raise and sell pastured beef, chicken, and pork. If you plan to cook while you are here let us know and you can order some homegrown meat ahead of time and we will have it waiting in your fridge. (Sausage or bacon for breakfast, steaks, hamburger, chicken breast, pork chops...) Bring a cooler so you can take some beef, chicken, and pork back home with you. You can see what's available and order directly through our website www.oldrichvalleyfarm dot com.","Hot tubs are very expensive.  We ask that you read and follow all rules of the hot tub (listed in the cabin) to make sure it doesn’t get damaged.

It is also close to Beckley and Princeton, Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve and southern WV whitewater country. During the ski season, we offer discounted equipment rentals from Ski Celebrations for all of our guests.

~ DETAILS ~
~ Sleeps: up to 10  (for stays under 10 days) 
~ Master Bedroom: 1 Queen Size Bed with attached bath 
~ Bedroom 2: 1 Queen Size Bed
~ Bunkroom: 2 Twin Size Beds (Bunk)
~ Living Room: 1 Double Size Futon and a pull out couch
~ Cable TV in Living Room and all three bed rooms
~ Fully Equipped Kitchen
~ Ski Rack
~ Small Dryer in the condo
~ Pets welcome with paid pet fee  (for stays under 10 days)  Contact us for more details. 
~ Views of Winterplace Ski Resort
The kitchen is totally equipped with all the essentials, including crock pot, coffee maker, pots and pans, a built-in microwave, dishwasher and everything that you need for your vacation. 
The living room consist of an electric fireplace and a view out the sliding glass doors onto the slopes. The master bedroom has a queen bed with a bath and views onto the mountains.
Everything you need to create great family memories!
The condo has electric baseboard heaters in each room, so you can adjust the heat to the temperature that you prefer when it's cold outside. When it's hot, there is an AC unit installed in the living room above the sliding glass door. This is for AC only. We are not allowed to do duct work in the 2nd or 3rd floor condos, so this is the only practical way to get AC in the unit, leaving room doors open as often as possible helps to keep the whole condo cool.
Please be aware there will be a $200 security deposit that will be pre-authorized on your credit card the day before you arrive and is released 7 days after you depart unless there is damage. This is a standard practice for vacation home rentals as there is no staff at the facility and this allows you to check in with an electronic door code and check out by just texting us and leaving the morning of your last day.
Also, the road to the condos is a gravel, hilly, road that Winterplace Ski Resort is paid to take care of it. Sometimes through the year, we will have heavy rains that create ruts in the road and Winterplace Ski Resort, being closed, is slow in making the repairs. Low clearance vehicles will need to be very careful coming up the hill from Winterplace Ski Resort's main parking area. In the winter, they grade the road and keep it plowed and put cinders on the road but please be prepared and understand you may need a four wheel drive, all wheel drive or chains to help get up the hill.
We highly recommend that you purchase travel insurance. Problems can arise in multiple ways and travel insurance can be a low cost guard against losing your money if you have last minute problems and have to cancel. In the past, some of our guests have obtained insurance by going to www.InsureMyTrip.com for details and to purchase. We did call the people at InsuraneMyTrip and they do have plans that will cover for Covid issues but there are several important steps and needs to be done shortly after making your first deposit. The plans are called ""Cancel For Any Reason"" CFAR. Check with your insurance agent before deciding what insurance to purchase. We DO NOT endorse any insurance in particular.
~Long Term Stays ~
For those looking to stay for more than a week, the following changes apply:
- We only allow 3 people to stay per condo
- No pets allowed
- We do not provide daily maid service but will provide clean linens weekly. 
Please contact us for further information.

It is also close to Beckley and Princeton, Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve and southern WV whitewater country. During the ski season, we offer discounted equipment rentals from Ski Celebrations for all of our guests.

~ DETAILS ~
~ Sleeps: up to 10  (for stays under 10 days) 
~ Master Bedroom: 1 Queen Size Bed with attached bath 
~ Bedroom 2: 1 Queen Size Bed
~ Bunkroom: 2 Twin Size Beds (Bunk)
~ Living Room: 1 Double Size Futon and L Shaped Sofa
~ Cable TV in Living Room and all three bed rooms
~ Fully Equipped Kitchen
~ Ski Rack

The kitchen is totally equipped with all the essentials, including crock pot, coffee maker, pots and pans, a built-in microwave, dishwasher and everything that you need for your vacation.
The living room consist of an electric fireplace and a view out the sliding glass doors onto the slopes. The master bedroom has a queen bed with a bath and views onto the mountains.
Everything you need to create great family memories!
The condo has electric baseboard heaters in each room, so you can adjust the heat to the temperature that you prefer when it's cold outside. When it's hot, there is an AC unit installed in the living room above the sliding glass door. This is for AC only. We are not allowed to do duct work in the 2nd or 3rd floor condos, so this is the only practical way to get AC in the unit, leaving room doors open as often as possible helps to keep the whole condo cool.
Please be aware there will be a $200 security deposit that will be pre-authorized on your credit card the day before you arrive and is released 7 days after you depart unless there is damage. This is a standard practice for vacation home rentals as there is no staff at the facility and this allows you to check in with an electronic door code and check out by just texting us and leaving the morning of your last day.
Also, the road to the condos is a gravel, hilly, road that Winterplace Ski Resort is paid to take care of it. Sometimes through the year, we will have heavy rains that create ruts in the road and Winterplace Ski Resort, being closed, is slow in making the repairs. Low clearance vehicles will need to be very careful coming up the hill from Winterplace Ski Resort's main parking area. In the winter, they grade the road and keep it plowed and put cinders on the road but please be prepared and understand you may need a four wheel drive, all wheel drive or chains to help get up the hill.
We highly recommend that you purchase travel insurance. Problems can arise in multiple ways and travel insurance can be a low cost guard against losing your money if you have last minute problems and have to cancel. In the past, some of our guests have obtained insurance by going to www.InsureMyTrip.com for details and to purchase. We did call the people at InsuraneMyTrip and they do have plans that will cover for Covid issues but there are several important steps and needs to be done shortly after making your first deposit. The plans are called ""Cancel For Any Reason"" CFAR. Check with your insurance agent before deciding what insurance to purchase. We DO NOT endorse any insurance in particular.
~Long Term Stays ~
For those looking to stay for more than a week, the following changes apply:
- We only allow 3 people to stay per condo
- No pets allowed
- We do not provide daily maid service but will provide clean linens weekly.

""The Gathering Place for Friends, Family and Fur Babies""

You will have the home to yourselves. The owner does not live in this home.

I love to meet all of my guests, however, I travel a lot for work and family so a friend/host may be there to greet you when I cannot.

The guesthouse is located in a nice, quiet neighborhood within walking distance of our lovely downtown area where you can make the short walk to local night life, restaurants and shops. We manage four of five houses on the street which are used as Airbnb homes and corporate rentals, so know who your neighbors are.

There are three off-street parking spaces behind the house exclusively for guest use and plenty of extra parking across the street in business parking lots that agree to overnight and weekend usage. If a private driver is needed, please let us know, and we can help you make arrangements with a local Uber driver.

We do not provide breakfast items for parties that book the house exclusively.","NO GUESTS UNDER THE AGE OF 18 ALLOWED. 19 AND ABOVE ONLY.

Try this condo in our off season (spring - fall) and enjoy a quiet place when your not out exploring WV. In winter, ski in and out from this condo onto the slopes of Winterplace Ski Resort.This condo is located on the third floor and the deck overlooks the 'Last Chance' and 'Last Run' trails. It is also close to Beckley and Princeton, Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve and southern WV whitewater country. During the ski season, we offer discounted equipment rentals from Ski Celebrations for all of our guests and for groups of 15 or more discounted lift tickets as well.
The condo sleeps up to 10, great for a large family or a couple of small families with separate bathrooms or for those that just want some space and privacy that you can't get in a hotel. Large deck to enjoy the views from.

The kitchen is totally equipped with all the essentials, including crock pot, coffee maker, pots and pans, a built-in microwave, dishwasher and everything that you need for your vacation. 
The living room consist of a wood burning fireplace and a view out the sliding glass doors onto the slopes. The master bedroom has a queen bed with a bath and views onto the mountains.
Everything you need to create great family memories!
The condo has electric baseboard heaters in each room, so you can adjust the heat to the temperature that you prefer when it's cold outside. When it's hot, there is an AC unit installed in the living room above the couch. This is for AC only. We are not allowed to do duct work in the 2nd or 3rd floor condos, so this is the only practical way to get AC in the unit, leaving room doors open as often as possible helps to keep the whole condo cool.
Please be aware there will be a $200 security deposit that will be pre-authorized on your credit card the day before you arrive and is released 7 days after you depart unless there is damage. This is a standard practice for vacation home rentals as there is no staff at the facility and this allows you to check in with an electronic door code and check out by just texting us and leaving the morning of your last day.
Also, the road to the condos is a gravel, hilly, road that Winterplace Ski Resort is paid to take care of it. Sometimes through the year, we will have heavy rains that create ruts in the road and Winterplace Ski Resort, being closed, is slow in making the repairs. Low clearance vehicles will need to be very careful coming up the hill from Winterplace Ski Resort's main parking area. In the winter, they grade the road and keep it plowed and put cinders on the road but please be prepared and understand you may need a four wheel drive, all wheel drive or chains to help get up the hill.
We highly recommend that you purchase travel insurance. Problems can arise in multiple ways and travel insurance can be a low cost guard against losing your money if you have last minute problems and have to cancel. In the past, some of our guests have obtained insurance by going to www.InsureMyTrip.com for details and to purchase. We did call the people at InsuraneMyTrip and they do have plans that will cover for Covid issues but there are several important steps and needs to be done shortly after making your first deposit. The plans are called ""Cancel For Any Reason"" CFAR. Check with your insurance agent before deciding what insurance to purchase. We DO NOT endorse any insurance in particular.

Although this beautiful property isn't far from restaurants and stores you will feel like you are a world away. This 3400 sq foot, 4 bedroom, 3 bath home is situated on 53 private acres bordering the Jefferson National Forest.   Enjoy private trails throughout the property. When daylight fades share stories with your family around a roaring campfire.   The lodge has a new filtration system for sulfur-free water.

The lodge has 4 bedrooms and a spacious loft overlooking the living room with full size bed, twin trundle bed and futon.  There is a bedroom upstairs with twin and toddler bed.  The king size master bedroom upstairs has a private bathroom.  The second king size bedroom located downstairs overlooks the creek as well as another bedroom downstairs with a full size bed.  The game room on the first floor has a futon sofa bed.

We are in a rural location; cell phone service is limited but we do have Hughesnet Satellite wi-fi, it doesn't stream video but allows for surfing the web, answering emails, wi-fi texting and calling(depending on you cell phone carrier plan).

As like many people in rural America we are on a well water system so the water has Sulphur, which is completely safe to drink and bath in but does have a Sulphur smell and is an acquired taste.  We supply a gallon of water but suggest our guests bring extra water for drinking due to the taste.

We are one hour from Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA and 55 minutes to Radford University.

We are pet friendly with lots of room for your pets to explore.
We charge a pet fee of $25 for the first pet per stay and $10 for each additional pet per stay. 

The pet fee is collected separately through AirBNB after the cabin is booked.

* Don't forget to bring your water shoes, folding chairs, beach towels and sunscreen.

***Please read below***

*The lodge has a neighboring cottage for rent on Airbnb, approximately 70 feet from the lodge called The Cottage on Little Creek (please see gallery for photo that shows proximity.


* Wi-Fi: 
As mentioned above, this is a rural location which is great to decompress and find peace and quiet but high-speed internet isn’t available in this area. We provide satellite internet, so guests can use Wi-Fi texting and calling (dependent on your cell provider- cell phone service is very limited), check emails and surf the web but streaming Netflix and downloading music unfortunately don’t work.  We have the highest number of gigabytes available with HughesNet Satellite but once the data caps are reached (which is easy to do if streaming is tried and continues to buffer) the internet eventually stops.  We ask you to please be conscientious with the internet usage, so all our guests are able to use it throughout their stay with us.

This place is so special, and we want our guests to love it as much as we do so if there is anything we can do throughout your stay we are happy to help.","PLEASE HONOR 10AM CHECK-OUT

When I vacation in the mountains, I like to feel very comfortable ! From the minute that I arrive, I want to feel like I'm vacationing in my second home. I don't want to check-in at an office, and then go park my car far away from me. I want a place that has easy access to me unloading all of my luggage, groceries, skis, snowboard, and kids!

The house sleeps at least 15+ people. There is a bedroom on the main level with a queen bed. There is a sleeper sofa in the living room. The upstairs has two bedrooms.  One has a king bed and the other room has a queen bed and a full bed. In the finished basement there is currently two twin beds and two full beds. There is also some room in the basement for some air mattresses if needed.

Linens are provided but towels are not.

We highly recommend that you purchase travel insurance. Problems can arise in multiple ways and travel insurance can be a low cost guard against losing your money if you have last minute problems and have to cancel. In the past, some of our guests have obtained insurance by going to various insurance sites for details and to purchase. We did call the people at InsureMyTrip and they do have plans that will cover for Covid issues but there are several important steps and needs to be done shortly after making your first deposit. The plans are called ""Cancel For Any Reason"" CFAR. Check with your insurance agent before deciding what insurance to purchase. We DO NOT endorse any insurance in particular.","No pets.

Are you a railroad enthusiast? Bluefield prospered as a center for the railroad transport of coal.  Norfolk Southern still maintains an office at 800 Princeton Avenue in downtown Bluefield. The city offers many vantage points for photography, with spots where you can pull off the road and take spectacular photos as the trains rumble by. Of interest to children: The Ridgerunner train leaves on a milelong loop, from noon to 6 p.m. on weekends, from Bluefield City Park from April through September, but be careful: That train whistle is loud! For researchers and scholars, a wealth of information is tucked away in the Eastern Regional Coal Archives, which are attached to the Craft Memorial Library in Bluefield, including railroad memorabilia, maps, company records and historic photographs and documents.

Both Bluefield, West Virginia, and Bluefield, Virginia, have extensive bus service. The driveway is large enough to accommodate a trailer.

Filled with glimpses of the past, guests enjoy charming antique-filled rooms, Wi-Fi, kitchen, new bath, queen bed, fireplace.  Near the New River Gorge National Park, Pipestem zipline, ATV trails, hiking, kayaking, caves/caverns & more. Watch deer graze in the pastures as you sit back and enjoy peace in the valley. Located just off I-77, exit 14. A step back in time ...

Guests will enjoy the whole house. Historic home is smoke free, pet free, and vape free. Each room is appointed with beautiful antique quilts, old trunks, and pieces of furniture used on the farm. It is like a museum! Of course, there has been added the modern recliner for sitting and sipping coffee while watching the deer eat apples from the old tree!

The main floor has a sunporch with a spectacular view of the valley. Guests can enjoy views of sunrise and sunset in both rain and shine! The main floor also has a kitchen, dining area, living room with fireplace, and sitting room. Beautiful tiled bathroom with shower is on main floor.  Choose to sleep on main floor or in loft. The loft has a queen size bed, sitting area, and closet. All rooms have antiques and beautiful furnishings.

If you are looking for pampered, modern conveniences this is not your place. If you want peace, quiet, tranquility amid old relics, antiques, and farm pastures you will enjoy this property. The homestead is much like it was during the time it was built (early 1900s). It is intended to give visitors and guests an idea of how living on the farm in the early years might have been. Not for the allergy sensitive as it is a farm with hayfields, etc.

Please note: This is an old cabin on a septic system in the countryside.  For safety reasons, we strictly enforce the use of it to 2 people ONLY. We do not share/offer property as a meeting or gathering place.

During the day, guests may enjoy a walk to the barn in the lower pastures (following the designated path only). There you can access the river and fish (bring your own fishing pole and/or kayak) or have fun just splashing around! This area is restricted to day use only and no ATVs or dirt bikes are allowed on the property. No sport shooting on property.

You may text me with questions at any time.

This property is located in the countryside surrounded by mountains and valleys. There are 2 churches (Methodist and Baptist), a post office, a school (K-5), and a small convenience store w gas/groceries is 3 miles away. This property is near Camp Creek State Forest, Pipestem, Bluestone State Parks, Pinnacle Rock State Park, outdoor rafting, ATV riding on the Hatfields and McCoys Trail, America's newest National park: The New River Gorge National Park, and much more! It takes approximately 5 minutes to reach Interstate 77 from the cabin, exit 14.

You will need transportation to get to everything to see and do. There is no public transit system in the countryside. :)

Ishmael's is located just below the cottage- we'll have it unlocked for you.  We do require that after any photographs, you throw your fish back in the pond. (Swimming is not allowed in the pond.) (Ice skating on the pond is also not allowed.)

We are currently building a pencil museum for Jill's collection.  The pencil museum opens up to our Blackberry Boardwalk.  It's a nice walkway through the edge of the woods near the pond.  It also helps make the blackberries more accessible during season (they're typically ripe in August and you're welcome to help yourself!) Although the museum is still in a construction phase, the Blackberry Boardwalk is complete.

Also, we are located in a very popular area for ATV riders.  We are 38.8 miles to the Pocahontas Trail Head (Hatfield & McCoy ATV & UTV Trails).  You are welcome to use any tools in our garage for maintenance of your ATV or UTV while you are visiting. 

You're free to walk throughout the property, including the gardens.  Please also treat the gardens like a buffet.  You're welcome to eat all of the vegetables and fruit you want while you're here.  You're also welcome to help with any animal chores and gardening (especially fun for kids!) and we love to answer any questions you have.

When it is time for your check-out, you can just walk away!  No cleaning or locking up needed.  We like for folks to be able to completely relax and not worry about any of the details. :-)","human","Stay in the Storybook Cottage at the Holliday Castle!  The Storybook Cottage is a tiny crooked fairytale house located behind our home (which is being converted into a castle!)  Enjoy the view from your private back porch! Close to ski resort!

The Storybook Cottage is a fairytale-inspired tiny crooked house.  The Cottage is located directly behind our house - which is in the process of being converted into a castle. Our property houses apple trees, plum trees, cherry trees, grapevines, peach trees, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, and pear trees- in addition to mass quantities of vegetables. 

In the photographs posted, you'll be able to see more about the property, the placement of the Cottage in relation to the main house, and some of the animals. :-)

In the Cottage, you'll find books, board games, and general whimsy. During the late spring and summer, the front porch opens up into an edible front yard- feel free to help yourself!  The back porch overlooks the pond (beautiful, but not suitable for skating!).  Rental of the cottage comes with access to the fishing supplies located in Ishmael's Tackle Shop.  Ishmael's is located just below the cottage- we keep it unlocked for our guests.  (However, swimming is not allowed in the pond- and when it's frozen over, no skating is allowed either.)

The Cottage is a tiny house, yet still has a lot of amenities!  You have your own private kitchenette, equipped with a sink, mini-fridge, breakfast station (which includes a coffee pot, toaster oven and griddle), a microwave and a table with seats for two.  (Due to the size of this kitchenette, we were unable to include a traditional oven with stovetop. If you have any questions about the kitchenette, please just let us know! ) This kitchenette also includes dishes (mugs, larger cups, plates, bowls and silverware)  and a folding tray for reading or enjoying your meals in bed.  During the warmer season, we provide a retro cooler for your use while fishing or picnicking.

You will also have your own private bathroom with an antique sink and claw foot tub (with shower).  We provide you with towels, washcloths, soap, shampoo, conditioner, bubble bath and a hair dryer. (If you've forgotten anything else, just let us know- we probably have extras!)

The Cottage also has, what we call, a ""mud room.""  It's a small room where you'll find a bench and a picnic basket (during season).  During the holidays, the mudroom is decked out with a Christmas tree. The mudroom is intended as a place for you to unload, store your umbrella and shed your shoes.  In the winter months, this room is also outfitted with boot warmers.  

The main room houses a queen size bed, a rocking chair, a tv (w/ dvd player), and a dresser (which converts into a lighted desk.) We also provide you with an iron and ironing board.  There is not a closet; however, there is a hook on the door for hanging your garment bag. The bedding is composed of two down alternative pillows, two ""SpaLuxury"" pillows, and two 100% cotton blankets.  There are three separate heaters located throughout the cottage. There is also a window air conditioner. The main room/bedroom overlooks the pond with an entire wall of windows (don't worry- there are room-darkening curtains if you prefer to sleep in!)  

If you would like to bring your child(ren), please send me a message beforehand.  I am sure that a small air mattress will fit beside the queen size bed (and I will prepare it for you!), but I want to share exact dimensions with you to ensure you'll be pleased with the layout of the room. Also, if you're bringing young children, please let me know!  I will ensure the cottage is stocked with some age-appropriate toys. 

Regarding breakfast, your kitchen will be stocked with a standard brew of coffee, as well as tea bags.  Upon your arrival, you will find a basket of fruit and zucchini bread (or something similar), as well as a couple bottles of water in your fridge. We have decided to leave this welcome/breakfast basket for you so as not to disturb your sleep the next morning.  During the winter months, your kitchen is also stocked with hot cocoa mix.

We currently have a dog, cats, and a chicken.  This past winter has been hard on the animals.  Pumpkin, our pet turkey passed away, as well as our duck, and one of the chickens. This spring (2023), we will be getting baby chickens, ducks and turkeys.

**Update April 2023:  We had a very bad windstorm and a handsome little rooster blew in and has fallen deeply in love with our Chicken Little.  They have moved into Pumpkin's old house and are inseparable. We realize he's an early riser and not all of us are--- so we are now providing ear plugs for each guest in the cottage (just in case.)

You will see us on the property.  We have five children living here, ranging in age from seven to eighteen.  Don't worry- they will not bother you at all- but you will probably see them outside playing.  If you need anything, I am a stay-at-home mom and am easily accessible during the day.  I can frequently be found in the kitchen, our library or the greenhouse.  We dearly love to show folks around our place and answer any questions you may have about our home, gardens, animals and/or the area.

Everything you need to create great family memories!
The condo has electric baseboard heaters in each room, so you can adjust the heat to the temperature that you prefer when it's cold outside. When it's hot, there is an AC unit installed in the living room above the sliding glass door. This is for AC only. We are not allowed to do duct work in the 2nd or 3rd floor condos, so this is the only practical way to get AC in the unit, leaving room doors open as often as possible helps to keep the whole condo cool.
Please be aware there will be a $200 security deposit that will be pre-authorized on your credit card the day before you arrive and is released 7 days after you depart unless there is damage. This is a standard practice for vacation home rentals as there is no staff at the facility and this allows you to check in with an electronic door code and check out by just texting us and leaving the morning of your last day.
Also, the road to the condos is a gravel, hilly, road that Winterplace Ski Resort is paid to take care of it. Sometimes through the year, we will have heavy rains that create ruts in the road and Winterplace Ski Resort, being closed, is slow in making the repairs. Low clearance vehicles will need to be very careful coming up the hill from Winterplace Ski Resort's main parking area. In the winter, they grade the road and keep it plowed and put cinders on the road but please be prepared and understand you may need a four wheel drive, all wheel drive or chains to help get up the hill.
We highly recommend that you purchase travel insurance. Problems can arise in multiple ways and travel insurance can be a low cost guard against losing your money if you have last minute problems and have to cancel. In the past, some of our guests have obtained insurance by going to www.InsureMyTrip.com for details and to purchase. We did call the people at InsuraneMyTrip and they do have plans that will cover for Covid issues but there are several important steps and needs to be done shortly after making your first deposit. The plans are called ""Cancel For Any Reason"" CFAR. Check with your insurance agent before deciding what insurance to purchase. We DO NOT endorse any insurance in particular.
~Long Term Stays ~
For those looking to stay for more than a week, the following changes apply:
- We only allow 3 people to stay per condo
- No pets allowed
- We do not provide daily maid service but will provide clean linens weekly.

NEAR BECKLEY AND WHITEWATER COUNTRY
During the spring, summer and fall don’t think there is nothing to do. We are close to all the fun that southern West Virginia has to offer. Whitewater rafting, kayaking, river tubing, rock climbing, hiking, horseback riding etc. All different kinds of outdoor fun are waiting for you to take advantage of. There are several state and national parks near by, like Little Beaver State Parkand Grandview National Park. We are also near Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve. The temperature in the mountains of West Virginia remains cooler than a lot of the surrounding states, so this is great place to come cool off. Enjoy something different from the beach, take your family out into nature.
And for anytime of the year fun, Beckley has something for everyone. Of course, there are all your favorite fast food and sit down restaurants, as well as some home-grown restaurants that might become your new favorites. There is a wide variety of different shops. The Tamarack has everything you might want to see from our unique West Virginia craftsman. There are a lot of different antique shops and Crossroads Mall for those that might want something a little familiar. There is the Beckley Exhibition Coal Mine, where you can tour an actual coal mine and let the kids explore the coal mining town and the Youth Museum. During good weather, there are also trails, playground, basketball and tennis courts and a pool with a waterslide. There is also, Mountain State Miniature Golfwhich doesn’t have just mini-golf but offers a small coffee shop and an indoor climbing wall.

They are provided for the safety, security, and protection of our guests, the owners, and the property. 

Please know that you can contact us anytime if you have a question or issue. We have family locally that can assist if needed.  Kristen’s cell phone number is (540)239-6882.  In case of an emergency, call 911 - the house address is 1120 Big Ridge Road, Independence, VA 24348. 

Base rules
   o NO SMOKING inside the house!  If you smoke, please do so outside, away from the house. Please clean up after yourself, and do not leave cigarettes or butts on the property. 
   o Please only park in the driveway, and do not drive across the yard or fields. Even though the house is privately situated in a rural area, we recommend locking your cars and not leaving valuables or food that might attract wildlife in your car.
   o Be sure to lock the house when you leave and at night.  This is for your safety. 
   o You may close the front gate at any time during your stay using the chain and snaplinks, but do not lock the padlock. Guests do not have the padlock key, and locking the gate could impede emergency services if needed. The gate will be open when you check in. 
   o There are two owner’s closet areas with locked doors, one upstairs in the loft area and one in the basement. In addition there are two sheds outside. We are the only key holder’s to these areas; please don't attempt to open or access those spaces. 
   o Trash: We will leave trash bags and cleaning supplies in the pantry closet in the kitchen, and under the bathroom sinks. At the end of your stay, make sure to bag all your trash for easy removal. County trash pickup is on Friday mornings, so if your booking includes a Friday morning, please feel free to use the service. Just have the bags of trash by the mailbox no later than 8:00am.  Please do not leave the bags out overnight, critters will get in the trash and make a huge mess.
   o Do not alter, adjust, or disconnect any electronics or connections to the network router, wifi, security system, or other connected devices without express permission.  You may manually adjust the thermostat to your comfort; but if you have a problem, or the HVAC doesn't seem to be working correctly, contact us immediately.
   o Do not use the fireplace without express permission. This is for your safety. 
   o Do not rinse heavy grease or other chemicals down drains. Dispose of large food scraps and/or grease in the trash, the garbage disposal is for small crumbs and plant matter only. Do not flush items other than bodily waste and toilet paper in the toilets. The house uses a septic system that will be damaged by draining or flushing non-degradeable materials. You may use the garbage disposal for rinsing light food waste, but for larger waste, feel free to deposit food scraps etc. in the woodline away from the house. 
   o There is a dehumidifier available in the basement. If you use it, please be sure to drain the basin if it fills up. 
   o Feel free to use the Roku television apps, but do not make purchases from accounts other than your own. If you log into your own accounts, be sure to log off before you leave, for your protection.

Checking out 
   o Please be courteous, and tidy up. Place all trash in bags or trash cans.
   o Load and run the dishwasher, handwash any non dishwasher-safe items, and leave them out to dry on a rack or pad. 
   o Leave bath and bed linens where they can be easily found. 
   o Check to be sure you haven't left anything behind. 
   o Turn off lights, and close and lock all windows and doors.
   o Return the house keys to the key lockbox, and reset the dials. 

Occupancy Rules
   o We do not allow extra guests to sleep at our Airbnb unless previously agreed upon during the booking process. Seven (7) is the maximum number of guests in the house.
   o No unregistered guest allowed due to insurance requirement.
   o Minimum age to rent the property is 24 years old. 
   o NO PARTIES or special events are allowed on the property without express prior written consent from the owners.  We will send an amended house rules document to cover any parties or special events we approve.
   o Pets are not allowed.

Outdoor Safety
   o Be aware there are wild and possibly dangerous animals on the property.  
   o No hunting, trapping, or game activities are allowed on the property. 
   o Respect property boundaries when exploring. Fencing exists along much of the property boundary, but all property lines are marked with orange blaze rings around trees approximately every 25 to 50 yards, and outward facing posted signs every 50 to 100 yard. If you think you've inadvertently left the property, it's ok, the neighbors are nice, but please retrace your path back. 
   o Do not wander in the woodline at night or in poor weather. Do not go down if you cannot come back up. There is steep and rough terrain throughout the property, including several cliffs and rock faces. We encourage you to seek adventure, but you are at your own risk, so do so within your capabilities. 

Care of Property
   o Please take care with the furniture and carpets. Accidents happen, but avoid putting wet items directly on wood surfaces, and be careful with food and drinks. If a spill occurs, clean it up quickly using provided supplies. 
   o Be courteous and take off muddy or wet shoes at the door and before walking into carpeted areas. 
   o If you break or damage anything, please let us know immediately. Guests will be liable for any broken items or damage to the property due to negligence or malice, but more importantly, even in the case of an accident we want to make sure the problem is corrected for your safety.

Privately situated with all-weather access via a paved road off US-21. When you’re not exploring the country outside the gates, you can roam 48 acres of authentic Appalachian terrain right on the property. You’ll find unimproved wildlife trails through the forested hills, large rock formations, a seasonal spring, and a cascading stream.

Three bedrooms sleep seven comfortably (4 adults, 3 kids). The spacious new kitchen has everything you need to settle in for a while with all the necessities. Sip your coffee over breakfast, and take in a gorgeous panoramic sunrise over distant hills before heading out for the day. Marvel at the warm glow lighting the valley right from a large sectional sofa as the sun sets. Enjoy a night cap outside and see millions of stars and the sweep of the Milky Way as you haven’t seen it before in Virginia from the deck after the sun sets.

We have a stone fire pit just off the back patio. Guests can relax in the evenings around a fire regardless of the season, while still enjoying all of our magnificent views!

We're so happy to have you as guests, and we want to make sure your stay is amazing. While very accessible and convenient to many stores, the house is in a rural area, and you'll want to be prepared to make the most of your stay. Please contact us with any questions you have about the amenities here before check in. We aren't local but we can walk you through a remote check in ahead of time, and we have family just down the road to help. See the additional information in this listing for complete details; some details are only available to guests with reservations.

Only minutes from the town of Independence and its historic courthouse, restaurants, shops, and seasonal farmers markets, Whitetail Spur is convenient to countless attractions in southwest Virginia and nearby North Carolina.  Hike the Appalachian Trail at Mt. Rogers, Virginia’s highest peak; go tubing and kayaking on the New River; or take a cruise along the Blue Ridge Parkway. The area is the home of Bluegrass music, and hosts several festivals and themed events throughout the year. Tour area wineries and catch trout for dinner from one of the many state-stocked streams.

Whitetail Spur has a presence on social media. Search for us by name on popular platforms to see additional photos and updates, and to share your experience with friends. We only accept booking requests through registered members on Airbnb.","You should receive and acknowledge these rules prior to check in. They are provided for the safety, security, and protection of our guests, the owners, and the property. 

Please know that you can contact us anytime if you have a question or issue. We have family locally that can assist if needed.  Kristen’s cell phone number is (540)239-6882.  In case of an emergency, call 911 - the house address is 1120 Big Ridge Road, Independence, VA 24348. 

Base rules
   o NO SMOKING inside the house!  If you smoke, please do so outside, away from the house. Please clean up after yourself, and do not leave cigarettes or butts on the property. 
   o Please only park in the driveway, and do not drive across the yard or fields. Even though the house is privately situated in a rural area, we recommend locking your cars and not leaving valuables or food that might attract wildlife in your car.
   o Be sure to lock the house when you leave and at night.  This is for your safety. 
   o You may close the front gate at any time during your stay using the chain and snaplinks, but do not lock the padlock. Guests do not have the padlock key, and locking the gate could impede emergency services if needed. The gate will be open when you check in. 
   o There are two owner’s closet areas with locked doors, one upstairs in the loft area and one in the basement. In addition there are two sheds outside. We are the only key holder’s to these areas; please don't attempt to open or access those spaces. 
   o Trash: We will leave trash bags and cleaning supplies in the pantry closet in the kitchen, and under the bathroom sinks. At the end of your stay, make sure to bag all your trash for easy removal. County trash pickup is on Friday mornings, so if your booking includes a Friday morning, please feel free to use the service. Just have the bags of trash by the mailbox no later than 8:00am.  Please do not leave the bags out overnight, critters will get in the trash and make a huge mess.
   o Do not alter, adjust, or disconnect any electronics or connections to the network router, wifi, security system, or other connected devices without express permission.  You may manually adjust the thermostat to your comfort; but if you have a problem, or the HVAC doesn't seem to be working correctly, contact us immediately.
   o Do not use the fireplace without express permission. This is for your safety. 
   o Do not rinse heavy grease or other chemicals down drains. Dispose of large food scraps and/or grease in the trash, the garbage disposal is for small crumbs and plant matter only. Do not flush items other than bodily waste and toilet paper in the toilets. The house uses a septic system that will be damaged by draining or flushing non-degradeable materials. You may use the garbage disposal for rinsing light food waste, but for larger waste, feel free to deposit food scraps etc. in the woodline away from the house. 
   o There is a dehumidifier available in the basement. If you use it, please be sure to drain the basin if it fills up. 
   o Feel free to use the Roku television apps, but do not make purchases from accounts other than your own. If you log into your own accounts, be sure to log off before you leave, for your protection.

Checking out 
   o Please be courteous, and tidy up. Place all trash in bags or trash cans.
   o Load and run the dishwasher, handwash any non dishwasher-safe items, and leave them out to dry on a rack or pad. 
   o Leave bath and bed linens where they can be easily found. 
   o Check to be sure you haven't left anything behind. 
   o Turn off lights, and close and lock all windows and doors.
   o Return the house keys to the key lockbox, and reset the dials. 

Occupancy Rules
   o We do not allow extra guests to sleep at our Airbnb unless previously agreed upon during the booking process. Seven (7) is the maximum number of guests in the house.
   o No unregistered guest allowed due to insurance requirement.
   o Minimum age to rent the property is 24 years old. 
   o NO PARTIES or special events are allowed on the property without express prior written consent from the owners.  We will send an amended house rules document to cover any parties or special events we approve.
   o Pets are not allowed.

Outdoor Safety
   o Be aware there are wild and possibly dangerous animals on the property.  
   o No hunting, trapping, or game activities are allowed on the property. 
   o Respect property boundaries when exploring. Fencing exists along much of the property boundary, but all property lines are marked with orange blaze rings around trees approximately every 25 to 50 yards, and outward facing posted signs every 50 to 100 yard. If you think you've inadvertently left the property, it's ok, the neighbors are nice, but please retrace your path back. 
   o Do not wander in the woodline at night or in poor weather. Do not go down if you cannot come back up. There is steep and rough terrain throughout the property, including several cliffs and rock faces. We encourage you to seek adventure, but you are at your own risk, so do so within your capabilities. 

Care of Property
   o Please take care with the furniture and carpets. Accidents happen, but avoid putting wet items directly on wood surfaces, and be careful with food and drinks. If a spill occurs, clean it up quickly using provided supplies. 
   o Be courteous and take off muddy or wet shoes at the door and before walking into carpeted areas. 
   o If you break or damage anything, please let us know immediately. Guests will be liable for any broken items or damage to the property due to negligence or malice, but more importantly, even in the case of an accident we want to make sure the problem is corrected for your safety.

Children play in the road so drive slowly on Quail Rd. Sometimes the neighbor's little dog will come up the driveway. He is a friendly dog.

Trailers enter at the upper, left gravel driveway and exit at the lower driveway.  Stay on the gravel especially with wet weather because the ground is slippery on the hillside. Don't park in front of the house.  You can drive your ATV on the gravel behind the house and unload at the patio.","Please drive very slow on our road because of children in the neighborhood.
Stay off the grass as much as possible. It will become slippery in rainy/snowy conditions.
Bag all trash and take out to the wooden box. 
If you park your SxS behind the house, be careful not to run into the propane tank.

The cottage features 3 spacious bedrooms, each on its own level; a fully equipped kitchen; great room; dining room; laundry room; and a 2nd-floor loft with pool table and doorway to the 16'-wide balcony. A 20' x 12' front deck offers space for outdoor relaxing and dining.

The cabin is beautifully decorated with an eclectic array of antiques, rustic pieces, industrial elements, and original artwork  and prints. The hardwood floors, white pine-clad walls, and timber framing all lend to the cozy cabin feel of the interior while  the steel and cable interior railings provide a tasteful industrial balance. The 2-tones of the more rustic board & batten and cedar shake exterior siding are offset by the dramatic use of structural steel for the balcony supports and deck and balcony railings.

We aren't local, but we're only a phone call or text away! We have local friends who are ready to help with any urgent needs.

The best thing about our river home is its surroundings. A short walk down our tree-lined driveway brings you to the beautiful river and the dramatic cliffs that flank the opposite side. Privately stocked with large rainbows and home to wild brookies, rainbows and browns, this section is a fisherman's paradise. Along privately maintained Little Rock Road, our stretch of river gets no pressure from the public. If fishing's not your thing, the river bank offers the perfect spot for hammock lounging/reading, taking in the scenery, or getting lost in the sounds of rushing mountain water.

Though situated in a private mountain river cove, our cottage is only 15 minutes from the amazing 35-mile Virginia Creeper Trail, a multi-purpose former railway accessed from charming Damascus VA (visitdamascus.org). The trail traverses miles of national forest and crosses numerous vintage rail trestles spanning rushing mountain whitewater. Local outfitters offer bike rentals and shuttles to the trail heads for a mostly peddle-free downhill ride through the incredible landscape. Affectionately monikered ""Trail Town USA"", in addition to the famous Virginia Creeper Trail, Damascus is a favorite stopover town on the Georgia-to-Maine Appalachian Trail. The town is home to many other hiking/biking trails, mountain rivers, waterfalls, caves and other natural attractions. The cottage is only 20 minutes from historic downtown Abingdon VA (visitabingdonvirginia.com). Abingdon is home to the historic and popular Barter Theatre (Est. 1933, Blt. 1829) - State Theater of VA;  the Martha Washington Inn & Spa (1832); The Tavern Restaurant (1779); and many other beautiful historic buildings, homes, sights, and wonderful restaurants and shops. Abingdon hosts many popular festivals throughout the year and was designated by USA Today as the Country's Best Small Town Food Scene in 2019 and 2020.

The property is quite remote; one of its most attractive features, in our opinion. A tradeoff is that our internet service is DSL.

We highly recommend that you purchase travel insurance. Problems can arise in multiple ways and travel insurance can be a low cost guard against losing your money if you have last minute problems and have to cancel. In the past, some of our guests have obtained insurance by going to various insurance sites for details and to purchase. We did call the people at InsureMyTrip and they do have plans that will cover for Covid issues but there are several important steps and needs to be done shortly after making your first deposit. The plans are called ""Cancel For Any Reason"" CFAR. Check with your insurance agent before deciding what insurance to purchase. We DO NOT endorse any insurance in particular.

Take in small town vibe at First Friday in Marion.  Enjoy hot tub, ping pong, billiards, croquet, or lolling by the river.  Welcome!  Come enjoy!

The River House is a gorgeous, quiet getaway perched sublimely on the banks of the South Fork of the mighty Holston River in the Adwolfe area of pastoral Smyth County, Virginia.  Nestled peacefully on five hundred feet of this state-hatchery supported trout stream, you’ll find your cares slipping into oblivion regardless of which riverside Adirondack chair or seat in the hot tub you pick.  Here time disappears as your rhythm changes with days dissolving into dusk, sunsets become sunrises and back again.  The sound of the river will resonate in your soul.  Perfectly placed on a private triangle of land, it commands hundreds of feet on the river.  And if you need anything you’re equidistant to Marion or Chilhowie, and even closer to Jefferson National Forest, Mount Rogers, and Grayson Highlands State Park.  

Once you’re acclimated to the serene sounds and sights of this constantly coursing stream, you’ll grow to love the subtle and supple quality of The River House.  Pulling into the driveway you’ll come first to the covered porch with several seating spaces for those times when the rain washes the valley.  Off to the right, along the riverbank is a raised deck, jutting out over the stream.  Further down the bank, are a row of inviting Adirondack chairs.  As I am in this narrative, you’ll find yourself irresistibly drawn to the outside because of its unique, natural power and beauty.  But come inside for a minute.  Let’s cross the threshold.  Here’s a modest but updated kitchen, replete with a coffee bar beside the front door to accommodate company in the kitchen. From the kitchen window you’ll see a wonderful view of the river wending its way north.  Looking left, you’ll see a generous, sunny family room with a café table and six chairs, an exquisite, tufted, Cordovan leather sofa, matching chair, and daybed with trundle for an extra two sleeping berths.  Sink your bare feet into the burgundy wool and silk Persian carpet.  Walk through this sunny space and you’ll enter the hallway to the sleeping quarters.  On the right is the master bedroom appointed with a stout, king-sized furniture suite, another exquisite Persian carpet and carved floral love seat.  Across the hall is the guest bedroom with another compelling queen set.  Our choice of bedding is the Frontgate Resort line.  Linens are from Macy’s Hotel Collection.  Bedding is dried “en plein air,” so you’ll slumber in fragrant mountain sunshine.   We don’t want to anesthetize you, but you’ll love your slumber as much as your waking hours!  

Let’s step down to the lower level and see what’s going on there.  Taking the staircase from the kitchen, we alight on the lower level.  We think you’ll be delighted with the 8’ Brunswick billiards table appointed nicely with a green and buff Tiffany-style billiards light overhead.  Adjacent is an intimate two-chair café table, and wide-screen opposite.  Especially in inclement weather this is another nice and separate gathering space.  We make it easy for folks to converge and diverge. 

Back through the kitchen we come to the large gathering room with full bath.  Quietly dominating this space is a scarlet Bokhara Persian carpet – truly art underfoot.  The generous leather furnishings, glow of the fireplace and overall ambiance may invite you to linger longer than you intended.  In cold weather you’ll love the fireplace radiating warmth and light.  With the spa towels and robes in the nearby armoire, it’s tempting to take a turn in the hot tub.  

Open the patio doors and step out onto the open deck.  Out here you’re going to find your senses beset by a panoply of natural amenities competing for your attention.  You’ll see and hear the unique sounds of the river, the trees waving across green meadows in the wafting wind.  Depending upon how your day has gone, you may just decide to plop down here on the patio to relax and decide what to do next.  That may constitute nothing more than enjoying the experience of the The River House. This open deck is a natural gathering place for sitting, talking, eating and engaging with friends and family surrounded by nature’s bounty and beauty.

Or, grab your towels and robes and head for the spa.  Follow the sidewalk to the Jacuzzi six-person spa with lighting, aqua massage jets for a moment of pure relaxation on the banks of the Holston River letting the water work its wonder.  Others may prefer relaxing on the river-bank in one of the Adirondack chairs.  Recline in these comfy seats and contemplate nothing more than the moving waters.  Or light a campfire in the copper pit or carry a basket of goodies down to the picnic table.  For group lawn games, you can choose between ping-pong, croquet or bocce ball.  You can also access the adjacent storage building with ping pong table and comfortable sofas. 
Here you’ll find three easy-mount bicycles for pure holiday fun.  And if you’d rather hike, we’re happy to provide a trail map to some of the prettier vantage points on our adjacent 240 acres.  You can easily hike 1-5 miles and picnic out in the open with some of Smyth County’s most spectacular views.  Check out our trail maps.  Did we mention trout fishing!  And you can also content yourselves streaming video inside or roaming around outside with our wi-fi music speaker.  Just come have fun!

As you can see, The River House is an experience waiting to unfold beautifully and uniquely for all of our guests.

Adwolfe is a picturesque pastoral valley in the lea of Flat Ridge section of Iron Mountain adjacent historic Mount Rogers.  The valley is dominated by the South Fork of the mighty Holston River, a state hatchery supported trout fishing destination.  The peace and quite may be overwhelming to city dwellers.  The sounds of rippling water over age-old rounded stones, the brilliance of starlight above an open meadow,  the smell of newly mowed hay, the tickle of dew-wet grass between your toes,  the taste of  grilled trout paired with your favorite Sauvignon Blanc...

The valley is dominated by the South Fork of the mighty Holston River, a state hatchery supported trout fishing destination.  The peace and quite may be overwhelming to city dwellers.

Where ever your senses carry you, we hope your river house experience will culminate in life-long memories of fun and affection shared with family and friends.",,"The River House is a gorgeous, quiet getaway perched sublimely on the banks of the South Fork of the mighty Holston River in the Adwolfe area of pastoral Smyth County, Virginia.  Nestled peacefully on five hundred feet of this state-hatchery supported trout stream, you’ll find your cares slipping into oblivion regardless of which riverside Adirondack chair or seat in the hot tub you pick.  Here time disappears as your rhythm changes with days dissolving into dusk, sunsets become sunrises and back again.  The sound of the river will resonate in your soul.  Perfectly placed on a private triangle of land, it commands hundreds of feet on the river.  And if you need anything you’re equidistant to Marion or Chilhowie, and even closer to Jefferson National Forest, Mount Rogers, and Grayson Highlands State Park.  

Once you’re acclimated to the serene sounds and sights of this constantly coursing stream, you’ll grow to love the subtle and supple quality of The River House.  Pulling into the driveway you’ll come first to the covered porch with several seating spaces for those times when the rain washes the valley.  Off to the right, along the riverbank is a raised deck, jutting out over the stream.  Further down the bank, are a row of inviting Adirondack chairs.  As I am in this narrative, you’ll find yourself irresistibly drawn to the outside because of its unique, natural power and beauty.  But come inside for a minute.  Let’s cross the threshold.  Here’s a modest but updated kitchen, replete with a coffee bar beside the front door to accommodate company in the kitchen. From the kitchen window you’ll see a wonderful view of the river wending its way north.  Looking left, you’ll see a generous, sunny family room with a café table and six chairs, an exquisite, tufted, Cordovan leather sofa, matching chair, and daybed with trundle for an extra two sleeping berths.  Sink your bare feet into the burgundy wool and silk Persian carpet.  Walk through this sunny space and you’ll enter the hallway to the sleeping quarters.  On the right is the master bedroom appointed with a stout, king-sized furniture suite, another exquisite Persian carpet and carved floral love seat.  Across the hall is the guest bedroom with another compelling queen set.  Our choice of bedding is the Frontgate Resort line.  Linens are from Macy’s Hotel Collection.  Bedding is dried “en plein air,” so you’ll slumber in fragrant mountain sunshine.   We don’t want to anesthetize you, but you’ll love your slumber as much as your waking hours!  

Let’s step down to the lower level and see what’s going on there.  Taking the staircase from the kitchen, we alight on the lower level.  We think you’ll be delighted with the 8’ Brunswick billiards table appointed nicely with a green and buff Tiffany-style billiards light overhead.  Adjacent is an intimate two-chair café table, and wide-screen opposite.  Especially in inclement weather this is another nice and separate gathering space.  We make it easy for folks to converge and diverge. 

Back through the kitchen we come to the large gathering room with full bath.  Quietly dominating this space is a scarlet Bokhara Persian carpet – truly art underfoot.  The generous leather furnishings, glow of the fireplace and overall ambiance may invite you to linger longer than you intended.  In cold weather you’ll love the fireplace radiating warmth and light.  With the spa towels and robes in the nearby armoire, it’s tempting to take a turn in the hot tub.  

Open the patio doors and step out onto the open deck.  Out here you’re going to find your senses beset by a panoply of natural amenities competing for your attention.  You’ll see and hear the unique sounds of the river, the trees waving across green meadows in the wafting wind.  Depending upon how your day has gone, you may just decide to plop down here on the patio to relax and decide what to do next.  That may constitute nothing more than enjoying the experience of the The River House. This open deck is a natural gathering place for sitting, talking, eating and engaging with friends and family surrounded by nature’s bounty and beauty.

Or, grab your towels and robes and head for the spa.  Follow the sidewalk to the Jacuzzi six-person spa with lighting, aqua massage jets for a moment of pure relaxation on the banks of the Holston River letting the water work its wonder.  Others may prefer relaxing on the river-bank in one of the Adirondack chairs.  Recline in these comfy seats and contemplate nothing more than the moving waters.  Or light a campfire in the copper pit or carry a basket of goodies down to the picnic table.  For group lawn games, you can choose between ping-pong, croquet or bocce ball.  You can also access the adjacent storage building with ping pong table and comfortable sofas. 
Here you’ll find three easy-mount bicycles for pure holiday fun.  And if you’d rather hike, we’re happy to provide a trail map to some of the prettier vantage points on our adjacent 240 acres.  You can easily hike 1-5 miles and picnic out in the open with some of Smyth County’s most spectacular views.  Check out our trail maps.  Did we mention trout fishing!  And you can also content yourselves streaming video inside or roaming around outside with our wi-fi music speaker.  Just come have fun!

As you can see, The River House is an experience waiting to unfold beautifully and uniquely for all of our guests.

Nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains just outside of Jefferson National Forest. All our neighbors are farmers, goats, cows, horses, and chickens. Nearest convenience store is 10 min and nearest grocery store is 20 min. It's rural mountain vacationing at its best!

There is room for 4 cars at the top of the driveway by the lodge. More cars can be parked lower on the property.

This is a remote property. There are some quirky things about it. The oven has to be lit by guests - we can't leave it on. There are bugs galore(hey, you are in the mountains) but oddly, no mosquitoes.  Sometimes things stop working but we have a property manager down the street who will assist guests with any problems. The views of the sky at night are spectacular and often you can see the milky way with the naked eye.","We have a well stocked bar in the main cabin and you are welcome to use it, but please be reasonable.

Parking notes;  Updated to reflect the new gravel parking area. If you have 3 trailers we recommend 2 of them being under 20' depending on tow vehicle length. If you have multiple longer Rigs or just want more space, there is also public parking for trucks/trailers in town. This would allow for parking longer rigs and just driving your SXS / ORV to the house.","Our home is designed for a maximum of 6 guests.

This is a mid-century modern-rustic cabin that has been recently updated. Please note a few things about the property’s access and safety. The cabin is completely surrounded by water (unless it’s a dry season). Access to the cabin is via a small walk bridge. Guest will have to carry their belongings about 15 yards (small cart provided) across the bridge. Though the surrounding water is pretty shallow, don't allow children to be unattended, they can drown! The upstairs bedroom access is via a spiral staircase and not elderly, handicapped or child friendly. The upstairs patio has dated hand rails and does not provide child friendly safety railing. We welcome all guests no matter age or condition, but just want our guest to know what to plan for. There is an additional fee for more than 4 people and a maximum total of 6 people allowed. Due to the unique location of the house and the fragile waste water system; please note that there is a strict 6 person limit for our property. Unless prior arrangements have been made, in writing, guest exceeding this limit will be financially responsible for the cost to have the system pumped and serviced, plus additional cleaning fees, extra person fees and any damages or fees associated with ignoring the rules of our property. Misrepresentation of actual number of guests just to avoid the extra person fee will also incur additional cleaning fees, extra person fees and any damages or fees associated with ignoring the rules of our property. Please note we have a no pet policy. All additional costs shall be billed through Airbnb and any fees they charge may apply. By checking in to our property, guests accept these rules and the responsibilities listed above. If you do not accept and wish to cancel, you may do so within the cancellation period and receive a refund.  Thanks for your understanding as we only want to be able to share and enjoy our property for many years to come.

In addition, we have the privilege of offering you the opportunity to schedule a massage during your getaway.  A local massage therapist can travel to the cabin to offer massage therapy at your convenience.
