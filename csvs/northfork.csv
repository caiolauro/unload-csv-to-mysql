Children play in the road so drive slowly on Quail Rd. Sometimes the neighbor's little dog will come up the driveway. He is a friendly dog.

Trailers enter at the upper, left gravel driveway and exit at the lower driveway.  Stay on the gravel especially with wet weather because the ground is slippery on the hillside. Don't park in front of the house.  You can drive your ATV on the gravel behind the house and unload at the patio.","Please drive very slow on our road because of children in the neighborhood.
Stay off the grass as much as possible. It will become slippery in rainy/snowy conditions.
Bag all trash and take out to the wooden box.

I am available to chat if you’d like suggestions on things to do or see or have any questions whatsoever.

Country setting with quick and easy access to I-77 by going down either side of the mountain on Route 19.

Though I grew up in South Florida, I loved my summers there away from the Florida heat. I hiked in the woods, swam in cold streams, explored waterfalls and fell in love. Being adventurous, I rapelled in the New River Gorge, skiied for the first time at Snowshoe and learned a love of rafting that continues today as I pursue trips on many Western Rivers in New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and Arizona.Life took me out west to Santa Fe, New Mexico where I pursued an art career and eventually a Real Estate career. I feel blessed to have helped my mother find her dream cabins, and to now again get to spend family time in this wonderful place. Many friends and family are still nearby and it is like coming “home” to stay at the cabins on Anam Cara Way.

We hope you will find joy, and peace, and feel that our home is your home when you stay at our sweet cabins.","121 Reviews","Identity verified","Danna","false","true","https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/306956733","306956733","true",,,,"2","Joined in November 2019","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/825f8b0d-ea09-410c-8cfd-cd4ab8b01478.jpg?aki_policy=profile_large","100%","within an hour","Danna","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/825f8b0d-ea09-410c-8cfd-cd4ab8b01478.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","3","0","70","Accuracy","4.8","0.962","10","Communication","4.9","0.982","10","Cleanliness","4.8","0.954","10","Location","4.9","0.982","10","Check-in","4.9","0.9720000000000001","10","Value","4.7","0.942","9","4.83","language_country","Entire cabin","entire_home","8","4","9","27","available_amenities","","Amenities",,,,,,,"human","The Whitetail is a conventional-style log cabin, cozy and appealing, with two bedrooms, two baths, living room, dining and kitchen; stone wood-burning fireplace, central A/C-heat.

Plenty of open space. Enjoy the mountain air. Close to the new Hatfield McCoy Warrior Trail.  Unload and you won’t have to haul your ATV/UTV again until you head home.  Many outlaw trails nearby. Right off Rt16.  

If you like riding curves on  motorcycles or sports cars we’re only 30 minutes from Back of the Dragon Visitors Center. 15 minutes to Berwind Lake. A great place to get away from it all!!

No access to attached garage.

As native Appalachians, my husband and I have a deep love for this region and its people and the tradition of hospitality.  We are both artists of sorts--I'm a freelance writer/reporter and he is a rock 'n roll keyboard player and works in the local school system. And we manage a herd of dairy goats, mostly LaMancha breed. All with names and personalities. Our place is about 15-20  minutes off off I-77. We're close to the notable ""Back of the Dragon"" motorcycle routes. And very close to some beautiful backroad bicycle routes. The scenery is beautiful all seasons of the year but especially the fall. We hope you'll visit!

 As for the goats, they are ""the greatest entertainers and the greatest time wasters"" as my dad used to say. He was a vet and built the house as a home and office. So it has a sort of historic/museum feel in certain sections. 

We don't guarantee food as part of our Airbnb listing,  but I love to cook and if I'm cooking, you're welcome to join us if you don't have other plans. 

Last but not least, we  love to know a little about our guests beforehand so PLEASE make sure you fill out the ""Describe Yourself"" questions under the Airbnb profile section to speed along the booking process.

There is a very large backyard (field) that kids can play in, and the driveway is perfect for bike riding. There is plenty of parking and you can enjoy the flicker of campfires from the campground across the road while having your own large, private area to yourself. There is a fire pit and outdoor seating area, plus a grill (both gas and charcoal provided) for outdoor cooking. The Campside Cottage is perfect for the couple looking to get away for a few days, or for the young family with small children.  Parents and guests of Emory & Henry Health Sciences students--we are located 2 miles from the Marion campus and would love to host you when you visit!","Campside Cottage--a vacation retreat located across from Camp Burson at the entrance of Hungry Mother State Park in Marion, Virginia.

That was the deciding decision for hosting the airbnb with brothers - Jamie and Troy with help from everyone else.

I am a retired art teacher from Taylor County WV and Lexington Senior High NC. I live in Thomasville NC with my husband who is also from McDowell County WV.

As native Appalachians, my husband and I have a deep love for this region and its people and the tradition of hospitality.  We are both artists of sorts--I'm a freelance writer/reporter and he is a rock 'n roll keyboard player and works in the local school system. And we manage a herd of dairy goats, mostly LaMancha breed. All with names and personalities. Our place is about 15-20  minutes off off I-77. We're close to the notable ""Back of the Dragon"" motorcycle routes. And very close to some beautiful backroad bicycle routes. The scenery is beautiful all seasons of the year but especially the fall. We hope you'll visit!

 As for the goats, they are ""the greatest entertainers and the greatest time wasters"" as my dad used to say. He was a vet and built the house as a home and office. So it has a sort of historic/museum feel in certain sections. 

We don't guarantee food as part of our Airbnb listing,  but I love to cook and if I'm cooking, you're welcome to join us if you don't have other plans. 

Last but not least, we  love to know a little about our guests beforehand so PLEASE make sure you fill out the ""Describe Yourself"" questions under the Airbnb profile section to speed along the booking process.

I'm in and out of the spaces with shared access but your bed and bath are always private. I like to socialize and interact with guests but I'm also happy to leave you to your own privacy.

There's a great little biking road about 1/4 mile from my home that lots of bikers love to ride. About 5 miles away is a great mountain bike trail at the Blfd WV city park. For more serious bikers, there's the Burkes Garden trail. 
For hikers, Lincolnshire Park, about 13 miles away in Tazewell, has features so beautiful you will think you're in the The Hobbit's  ""Shire."" 
For other things to do and places to eat, see my Guidebook section of Guest Resources.

The Town of Bluefield, Va. operates Graham Transit. Graham Transit runs three deviated fixed routes throughout the area each day. I am a 5 minute walk from the closest bus route stop.  Bus route schedules are listed on the Town of Bluefield, Va. official website.

Please have the the Airbnb ""describe yourself"" profile questions filled out (type traveler you are, etc) before you request to book. Also, the local (county) occupancy tax is included in the room price.","I ask guests to avoid any scented (fragranced)  body lotions,  colognes, shampoos etc  in the house. Other guests may also be staying here who have allergies and sensitivities. And for housekeeping, it can take multiple washings to remove some scents.  I do offer fragrance-free shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap, or  laundry soap as amenities that you are welcome to use!   GOATS: Please check with me before feeding them or opening gates. CHECKOUT: If your stay is on a Saturday, I request a 9 a.m. Sunday checkout, but any other day it's 10 a.m. as listed.Thank you!","I'm in and out of the spaces with shared access but your bed and bath are always private.

Sit on the porch and soak up those mountain views. Relax in the hot tub and count the stars. Reconnect with your spouse as you unplug from the hustle and bustle. Rest, laugh, enjoy! 

The cabin is located on a working family farm. You can purchase beef, pork, and chicken to cook while you’re here or bring a cooler and take some home.

Take a break from life. Get away. Come relax in solitude or with your spouse. Reconnect with nature. Breathe in that fresh air. Observe wildlife and get a taste of life on the farm.

The cabin completely private, but if you’d like to visit with family or friends there is another cabin located on the farm too. Check out our other listing for Valley View Cabin. You cannot see the other cabin, but it is located a couple hundred yards away.

You will have the entire cabin to yourself. You can go for a walk, enjoy the hot tub, grill out, roast marshmallows over the fire pit, or just rock on the front porch and take it easy.

We are available by phone (call or text) if you need anything.  We can offer suggestions of things to do while here (folder of information in the cabin). If we’re around we’d be happy to show you around the farm.

We are about a mile off of Hwy 16 (Back of the Dragon). About 10 miles from Hungry Mother State Park (hiking, fishing, beach swimming area...). We’re 25 minutes from Marion where there is an adorable Main Street with shops and eateries.  We are about 45 minutes from Abingdon (Barter Theatre, antique shopping, dining, winery...).

We are not near any public transportation.

We are about 25 minutes away from town. So, you may want to plan to stop at the grocery store on your way in. There are plenty of great restaurants in Marion. (We have a list of restaurants and activities to do while here.) FYI: Many of the Marion shops/restaurants are CLOSED on Mondays!

Parking area, backyard, back porch (patio) and the entire suite is accessible to guests. The laundry room is down a shared staircase but is exclusive to the suite.

Host is nearby. If you need anything, please don't hesitate to ask! On longer stays, we will be in to clean the suite at least once every two weeks.

Are you a railroad enthusiast? Bluefield prospered as a center for the railroad transport of coal.  Norfolk Southern still maintains an office at 800 Princeton Avenue in downtown Bluefield. The city offers many vantage points for photography, with spots where you can pull off the road and take spectacular photos as the trains rumble by. Of interest to children: The Ridgerunner train leaves on a milelong loop, from noon to 6 p.m. on weekends, from Bluefield City Park from April through September, but be careful: That train whistle is loud! For researchers and scholars, a wealth of information is tucked away in the Eastern Regional Coal Archives, which are attached to the Craft Memorial Library in Bluefield, including railroad memorabilia, maps, company records and historic photographs and documents.

Both Bluefield, West Virginia, and Bluefield, Virginia, have extensive bus service. The driveway is large enough to accommodate a trailer. 
ATV parking may be arranged off-site.

Contact host for parking instructions and keypad code.","ADDITIONAL GUESTS -- contact host if you would like to add a third person to your stay. UPON CHECKOUT -- no need to wash linens, just please text or message host when you leave.

Rental of the cottage includes a souvenir fishing permit.  This will give you complete access to the fishing supplies in Ishmael's Tackle Shop.  Ishmael's is located just below the cottage- we'll have it unlocked for you.  We do require that after any photographs, you throw your fish back in the pond. (Swimming is not allowed in the pond.) (Ice skating on the pond is also not allowed.)

We are currently building a pencil museum for Jill's collection.  The pencil museum opens up to our Blackberry Boardwalk.  It's a nice walkway through the edge of the woods near the pond.  It also helps make the blackberries more accessible during season (they're typically ripe in August and you're welcome to help yourself!) Although the museum is still in a construction phase, the Blackberry Boardwalk is complete.

Also, we are located in a very popular area for ATV riders.  We are 38.8 miles to the Pocahontas Trail Head (Hatfield & McCoy ATV & UTV Trails).  You are welcome to use any tools in our garage for maintenance of your ATV or UTV while you are visiting. 

You're free to walk throughout the property, including the gardens.  Please also treat the gardens like a buffet.  You're welcome to eat all of the vegetables and fruit you want while you're here.  You're also welcome to help with any animal chores and gardening (especially fun for kids!) and we love to answer any questions you have.

When it is time for your check-out, you can just walk away!  No cleaning or locking up needed.  We like for folks to be able to completely relax and not worry about any of the details. :-)","human","Stay in the Storybook Cottage at the Holliday Castle!  The Storybook Cottage is a tiny crooked fairytale house located behind our home (which is being converted into a castle!)  Enjoy the view from your private back porch! Close to ski resort!

The Storybook Cottage is a fairytale-inspired tiny crooked house.  The Cottage is located directly behind our house - which is in the process of being converted into a castle. Our property houses apple trees, plum trees, cherry trees, grapevines, peach trees, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, and pear trees- in addition to mass quantities of vegetables. 

In the photographs posted, you'll be able to see more about the property, the placement of the Cottage in relation to the main house, and some of the animals. :-)

In the Cottage, you'll find books, board games, and general whimsy. During the late spring and summer, the front porch opens up into an edible front yard- feel free to help yourself!  The back porch overlooks the pond (beautiful, but not suitable for skating!).  Rental of the cottage comes with access to the fishing supplies located in Ishmael's Tackle Shop.  Ishmael's is located just below the cottage- we keep it unlocked for our guests.  (However, swimming is not allowed in the pond- and when it's frozen over, no skating is allowed either.)

The Cottage is a tiny house, yet still has a lot of amenities!  You have your own private kitchenette, equipped with a sink, mini-fridge, breakfast station (which includes a coffee pot, toaster oven and griddle), a microwave and a table with seats for two.  (Due to the size of this kitchenette, we were unable to include a traditional oven with stovetop. If you have any questions about the kitchenette, please just let us know! ) This kitchenette also includes dishes (mugs, larger cups, plates, bowls and silverware)  and a folding tray for reading or enjoying your meals in bed.  During the warmer season, we provide a retro cooler for your use while fishing or picnicking.

You will also have your own private bathroom with an antique sink and claw foot tub (with shower).  We provide you with towels, washcloths, soap, shampoo, conditioner, bubble bath and a hair dryer. (If you've forgotten anything else, just let us know- we probably have extras!)

The Cottage also has, what we call, a ""mud room.""  It's a small room where you'll find a bench and a picnic basket (during season).  During the holidays, the mudroom is decked out with a Christmas tree. The mudroom is intended as a place for you to unload, store your umbrella and shed your shoes.  In the winter months, this room is also outfitted with boot warmers.  

The main room houses a queen size bed, a rocking chair, a tv (w/ dvd player), and a dresser (which converts into a lighted desk.) We also provide you with an iron and ironing board.  There is not a closet; however, there is a hook on the door for hanging your garment bag. The bedding is composed of two down alternative pillows, two ""SpaLuxury"" pillows, and two 100% cotton blankets.  There are three separate heaters located throughout the cottage. There is also a window air conditioner. The main room/bedroom overlooks the pond with an entire wall of windows (don't worry- there are room-darkening curtains if you prefer to sleep in!)  

If you would like to bring your child(ren), please send me a message beforehand.  I am sure that a small air mattress will fit beside the queen size bed (and I will prepare it for you!), but I want to share exact dimensions with you to ensure you'll be pleased with the layout of the room. Also, if you're bringing young children, please let me know!  I will ensure the cottage is stocked with some age-appropriate toys. 

Regarding breakfast, your kitchen will be stocked with a standard brew of coffee, as well as tea bags.  Upon your arrival, you will find a basket of fruit and zucchini bread (or something similar), as well as a couple bottles of water in your fridge. We have decided to leave this welcome/breakfast basket for you so as not to disturb your sleep the next morning.  During the winter months, your kitchen is also stocked with hot cocoa mix.

We currently have a dog, cats, and a chicken.  This past winter has been hard on the animals.  Pumpkin, our pet turkey passed away, as well as our duck, and one of the chickens. This spring (2023), we will be getting baby chickens, ducks and turkeys.

**Update April 2023:  We had a very bad windstorm and a handsome little rooster blew in and has fallen deeply in love with our Chicken Little.  They have moved into Pumpkin's old house and are inseparable. We realize he's an early riser and not all of us are--- so we are now providing ear plugs for each guest in the cottage (just in case.)

The entire Cottage is for your use.

You will see us on the property.  We have five children living here, ranging in age from seven to eighteen.  Don't worry- they will not bother you at all- but you will probably see them outside playing.  If you need anything, I am a stay-at-home mom and am easily accessible during the day.  I can frequently be found in the kitchen, our library or the greenhouse.  We dearly love to show folks around our place and answer any questions you may have about our home, gardens, animals and/or the area.

During the warmer season, we provide a retro cooler for your use while fishing or picnicking.

You will also have your own private bathroom with an antique sink and claw foot tub (with shower).  We provide you with towels, washcloths, soap, shampoo, conditioner, bubble bath and a hair dryer. (If you've forgotten anything else, just let us know- we probably have extras!)

The Cottage also has, what we call, a ""mud room.""  It's a small room where you'll find a bench and a picnic basket (during season).  During the holidays, the mudroom is decked out with a Christmas tree. The mudroom is intended as a place for you to unload, store your umbrella and shed your shoes.  In the winter months, this room is also outfitted with boot warmers.  

The main room houses a queen size bed, a rocking chair, a tv (w/ dvd player), and a dresser (which converts into a lighted desk.) We also provide you with an iron and ironing board.  There is not a closet; however, there is a hook on the door for hanging your garment bag. The bedding is composed of two down alternative pillows, two ""SpaLuxury"" pillows, and two 100% cotton blankets.  There are three separate heaters located throughout the cottage. There is also a window air conditioner. The main room/bedroom overlooks the pond with an entire wall of windows (don't worry- there are room-darkening curtains if you prefer to sleep in!)  

If you would like to bring your child(ren), please send me a message beforehand.  I am sure that a small air mattress will fit beside the queen size bed (and I will prepare it for you!), but I want to share exact dimensions with you to ensure you'll be pleased with the layout of the room. Also, if you're bringing young children, please let me know!  I will ensure the cottage is stocked with some age-appropriate toys. 

Regarding breakfast, your kitchen will be stocked with a standard brew of coffee, as well as tea bags.  Upon your arrival, you will find a basket of fruit and zucchini bread (or something similar), as well as a couple bottles of water in your fridge. We have decided to leave this welcome/breakfast basket for you so as not to disturb your sleep the next morning.  During the winter months, your kitchen is also stocked with hot cocoa mix.

We currently have a dog, cats, and a chicken.  This past winter has been hard on the animals.  Pumpkin, our pet turkey passed away, as well as our duck, and one of the chickens. This spring (2023), we will be getting baby chickens, ducks and turkeys.

**Update April 2023:  We had a very bad windstorm and a handsome little rooster blew in and has fallen deeply in love with our Chicken Little.  They have moved into Pumpkin's old house and are inseparable. We realize he's an early riser and not all of us are--- so we are now providing ear plugs for each guest in the cottage (just in case.)","Stay in the Storybook Cottage at the Holliday Castle!

Filled with glimpses of the past, guests enjoy charming antique-filled rooms, Wi-Fi, kitchen, new bath, queen bed, fireplace.  Near the New River Gorge National Park, Pipestem zipline, ATV trails, hiking, kayaking, caves/caverns & more. Watch deer graze in the pastures as you sit back and enjoy peace in the valley. Located just off I-77, exit 14. A step back in time ...

Guests will enjoy the whole house. Historic home is smoke free, pet free, and vape free. Each room is appointed with beautiful antique quilts, old trunks, and pieces of furniture used on the farm. It is like a museum! Of course, there has been added the modern recliner for sitting and sipping coffee while watching the deer eat apples from the old tree!

The main floor has a sunporch with a spectacular view of the valley. Guests can enjoy views of sunrise and sunset in both rain and shine! The main floor also has a kitchen, dining area, living room with fireplace, and sitting room. Beautiful tiled bathroom with shower is on main floor.  Choose to sleep on main floor or in loft. The loft has a queen size bed, sitting area, and closet. All rooms have antiques and beautiful furnishings.

If you are looking for pampered, modern conveniences this is not your place. If you want peace, quiet, tranquility amid old relics, antiques, and farm pastures you will enjoy this property. The homestead is much like it was during the time it was built (early 1900s). It is intended to give visitors and guests an idea of how living on the farm in the early years might have been. Not for the allergy sensitive as it is a farm with hayfields, etc.

Please note: This is an old cabin on a septic system in the countryside.  For safety reasons, we strictly enforce the use of it to 2 people ONLY. We do not share/offer property as a meeting or gathering place.

During the day, guests may enjoy a walk to the barn in the lower pastures (following the designated path only). There you can access the river and fish (bring your own fishing pole and/or kayak) or have fun just splashing around! This area is restricted to day use only and no ATVs or dirt bikes are allowed on the property. No sport shooting on property.

You may text me with questions at any time.

This property is located in the countryside surrounded by mountains and valleys. There are 2 churches (Methodist and Baptist), a post office, a school (K-5), and a small convenience store w gas/groceries is 3 miles away. This property is near Camp Creek State Forest, Pipestem, Bluestone State Parks, Pinnacle Rock State Park, outdoor rafting, ATV riding on the Hatfields and McCoys Trail, America's newest National park: The New River Gorge National Park, and much more! It takes approximately 5 minutes to reach Interstate 77 from the cabin, exit 14.

You will need transportation to get to everything to see and do. There is no public transit system in the countryside. :)

We opened A Bit of Heaven Rental in Sept. 2018 when the trails opened in our area. We currently have 5 units we rent. We also opened A Scoop of Heaven Icecream in 2021.
We live local across the street from The Calvary House and are available if you need us. We love the small town atmosphere that our town has to offer and the friendly folks that live here.
I love to cook and spend time with our family and grandbabies. 
We enjoy meeting new people, having cookouts in the summer, and going to the lake.","524 Reviews","Identity verified","Mary & Rick","false","true","https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/155623730","155623730","true",,,,"5","Joined in October 2017","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/24e51cba-d09a-4763-8a0e-86b69a3b75d7.jpg?aki_policy=profile_large","100%","within an hour","Mary & Rick","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/24e51cba-d09a-4763-8a0e-86b69a3b75d7.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","5","0","82","Accuracy","4.9","0.978","10","Communication","5.0","0.992","10","Cleanliness","4.9","0.982","10","Location","4.7","0.942","9","Check-in","5.0","0.998","10","Value","5.0","0.992","10","4.93","language_country","Entire guest suite","entire_home","8","4","9","1","available_amenities","","Amenities","36",,"unavailable_safety_amenities","The host hasn't reported a carbon monoxide detector on the property.","Amenities","Guest have full access with private entrance and private parking.
