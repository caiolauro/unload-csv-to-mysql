This is a vacation rental agreement under the North Carolina Vacation Rental Act.  The rights and obligations of the parties to this agreement are defined by law and include unique provisions permitting the disbursement of rent prior to tenancy and expedited eviction of tenants.  Your signature on this agreement, or payment of money, or taking possession of the property after receipt of this agreement, is evidence of your acceptance of the agreement and your intent to use this property for a vacation rental.  Rentals exceeding 90 days do not fall under the NC vacation rental management act and are not subject to the same protections adhered to by the NC Vacation Rental Management Act.

Maximum occupancy must be strictly adhered to.  Occupancy count includes children.  Exceeding the occupancy limit set for your unit is ground for immediate eviction.  No exceptions and no refunds!

Accidental Damage Protector & Security Deposits:  The Accidental Damage Protection Plan is included in the advertised total amount and indemnifies you and your family up to $1500 for any accidental damage during your stay. All accidental damage must be reported to our office in writing by the end of renter’s stay in order for Damage Protector to apply.  Damage Protector is a surety contract and is not insurance.  RRR is not an insurer, insurance agent or underwriter.  The Accidental Damage Protection is non refundable.  Damage Protector does NOT cover intentional damage, excessive cleaning, theft, Acts of God, gross negligence, pet damage, utilities, rent, pay for view cable charges, additional costs incurred during stay per renter’s request, or loss of use.  Any intentional property damage or items listed above will be billed to the renter and may be charged to renter’s account or credit card on file without renter’s consent if RRR is unable to contact renter to request authorization.  

A security deposit can be elected in lieu of Accidental Damage Protection.  The cost ranges from $200 to $800 depending on the rental unit.  It is fully refundable by mail within 30 days of departure providing no damages have been made to the unit and the unit has been left tidy (according to our check out procedures) or (less any allowable deductions).  The security deposit can be paid in advance by personal check, money order, certified funds or credit card. Security deposits paid upon arrival must be paid by cash or credit card only. 

A few homes may require an additional security deposit beyond what is required above in this rental agreement.

This is a vacation rental agreement under the North Carolina Vacation Rental Act.  The rights and obligations of the parties to this agreement are defined by law and include unique provisions permitting the disbursement of rent prior to tenancy and expedited eviction of tenants.  Your signature on this agreement, or payment of money, or taking possession of the property after receipt of this agreement, is evidence of your acceptance of the agreement and your intent to use this property for a vacation rental.  Rentals exceeding 90 days do not fall under the NC vacation rental management act and are not subject to the same protections adhered to by the NC Vacation Rental Management Act.

Maximum occupancy must be strictly adhered to.  Occupancy count includes children.  Exceeding the occupancy limit set for your unit is ground for immediate eviction.  No exceptions and no refunds!

A security deposit can be elected in lieu of Accidental Damage Protection.  The cost ranges from $200 to $800 depending on the rental unit.  It is fully refundable by mail within 30 days of departure providing no damages have been made to the unit and the unit has been left tidy (according to our check out procedures) or (less any allowable deductions).

If you plan to cook while you are here let us know and you can order some homegrown meat ahead of time and we will have it waiting in your fridge.

Are you a railroad enthusiast? Bluefield prospered as a center for the railroad transport of coal.  Norfolk Southern still maintains an office at 800 Princeton Avenue in downtown Bluefield. The city offers many vantage points for photography, with spots where you can pull off the road and take spectacular photos as the trains rumble by. Of interest to children: The Ridgerunner train leaves on a milelong loop, from noon to 6 p.m. on weekends, from Bluefield City Park from April through September, but be careful: That train whistle is loud! For researchers and scholars, a wealth of information is tucked away in the Eastern Regional Coal Archives, which are attached to the Craft Memorial Library in Bluefield, including railroad memorabilia, maps, company records and historic photographs and documents.

Both Bluefield, West Virginia, and Bluefield, Virginia, have extensive bus service. The driveway is large enough to accommodate a trailer. 
ATV parking may be arranged off-site.

Ishmael's is located just below the cottage- we'll have it unlocked for you.  We do require that after any photographs, you throw your fish back in the pond. (Swimming is not allowed in the pond.) (Ice skating on the pond is also not allowed.)

We are currently building a pencil museum for Jill's collection.  The pencil museum opens up to our Blackberry Boardwalk.  It's a nice walkway through the edge of the woods near the pond.  It also helps make the blackberries more accessible during season (they're typically ripe in August and you're welcome to help yourself!) Although the museum is still in a construction phase, the Blackberry Boardwalk is complete.

Also, we are located in a very popular area for ATV riders.  We are 38.8 miles to the Pocahontas Trail Head (Hatfield & McCoy ATV & UTV Trails).  You are welcome to use any tools in our garage for maintenance of your ATV or UTV while you are visiting. 

You're free to walk throughout the property, including the gardens.  Please also treat the gardens like a buffet.  You're welcome to eat all of the vegetables and fruit you want while you're here.  You're also welcome to help with any animal chores and gardening (especially fun for kids!) and we love to answer any questions you have.

When it is time for your check-out, you can just walk away!  No cleaning or locking up needed.  We like for folks to be able to completely relax and not worry about any of the details. :-)","human","Stay in the Storybook Cottage at the Holliday Castle!  The Storybook Cottage is a tiny crooked fairytale house located behind our home (which is being converted into a castle!)  Enjoy the view from your private back porch! Close to ski resort!

The Storybook Cottage is a fairytale-inspired tiny crooked house.  The Cottage is located directly behind our house - which is in the process of being converted into a castle. Our property houses apple trees, plum trees, cherry trees, grapevines, peach trees, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, and pear trees- in addition to mass quantities of vegetables. 

In the photographs posted, you'll be able to see more about the property, the placement of the Cottage in relation to the main house, and some of the animals. :-)

In the Cottage, you'll find books, board games, and general whimsy. During the late spring and summer, the front porch opens up into an edible front yard- feel free to help yourself!  The back porch overlooks the pond (beautiful, but not suitable for skating!).  Rental of the cottage comes with access to the fishing supplies located in Ishmael's Tackle Shop.  Ishmael's is located just below the cottage- we keep it unlocked for our guests.  (However, swimming is not allowed in the pond- and when it's frozen over, no skating is allowed either.)

The Cottage is a tiny house, yet still has a lot of amenities!  You have your own private kitchenette, equipped with a sink, mini-fridge, breakfast station (which includes a coffee pot, toaster oven and griddle), a microwave and a table with seats for two.  (Due to the size of this kitchenette, we were unable to include a traditional oven with stovetop. If you have any questions about the kitchenette, please just let us know! ) This kitchenette also includes dishes (mugs, larger cups, plates, bowls and silverware)  and a folding tray for reading or enjoying your meals in bed.  During the warmer season, we provide a retro cooler for your use while fishing or picnicking.

You will also have your own private bathroom with an antique sink and claw foot tub (with shower).  We provide you with towels, washcloths, soap, shampoo, conditioner, bubble bath and a hair dryer. (If you've forgotten anything else, just let us know- we probably have extras!)

The Cottage also has, what we call, a ""mud room.""  It's a small room where you'll find a bench and a picnic basket (during season).  During the holidays, the mudroom is decked out with a Christmas tree. The mudroom is intended as a place for you to unload, store your umbrella and shed your shoes.  In the winter months, this room is also outfitted with boot warmers.  

The main room houses a queen size bed, a rocking chair, a tv (w/ dvd player), and a dresser (which converts into a lighted desk.) We also provide you with an iron and ironing board.  There is not a closet; however, there is a hook on the door for hanging your garment bag. The bedding is composed of two down alternative pillows, two ""SpaLuxury"" pillows, and two 100% cotton blankets.  There are three separate heaters located throughout the cottage. There is also a window air conditioner. The main room/bedroom overlooks the pond with an entire wall of windows (don't worry- there are room-darkening curtains if you prefer to sleep in!)  

If you would like to bring your child(ren), please send me a message beforehand.  I am sure that a small air mattress will fit beside the queen size bed (and I will prepare it for you!), but I want to share exact dimensions with you to ensure you'll be pleased with the layout of the room. Also, if you're bringing young children, please let me know!  I will ensure the cottage is stocked with some age-appropriate toys. 

Regarding breakfast, your kitchen will be stocked with a standard brew of coffee, as well as tea bags.  Upon your arrival, you will find a basket of fruit and zucchini bread (or something similar), as well as a couple bottles of water in your fridge. We have decided to leave this welcome/breakfast basket for you so as not to disturb your sleep the next morning.  During the winter months, your kitchen is also stocked with hot cocoa mix.

We currently have a dog, cats, and a chicken.  This past winter has been hard on the animals.  Pumpkin, our pet turkey passed away, as well as our duck, and one of the chickens. This spring (2023), we will be getting baby chickens, ducks and turkeys.

**Update April 2023:  We had a very bad windstorm and a handsome little rooster blew in and has fallen deeply in love with our Chicken Little.  They have moved into Pumpkin's old house and are inseparable. We realize he's an early riser and not all of us are--- so we are now providing ear plugs for each guest in the cottage (just in case.)

You will see us on the property.  We have five children living here, ranging in age from seven to eighteen.  Don't worry- they will not bother you at all- but you will probably see them outside playing.  If you need anything, I am a stay-at-home mom and am easily accessible during the day.  I can frequently be found in the kitchen, our library or the greenhouse.  We dearly love to show folks around our place and answer any questions you may have about our home, gardens, animals and/or the area.

We typically let guests do self check in, sometimes my husband does like to meet the guests if he’s available when they arrive. We are here should any issues occur.

The cabin is close to the town but still secluded, a 24 hour gas station and restaurants are very close by.

The driveway is steep, any guest with a trailer will need a 4 wheel drive. Any large trailer will need to park on the flat right below the driveway. A 4wd is typically preferred but many cars have made it with no trouble. During the winter months of snow/ice should be present, access to the cabin could be difficult but parking and walking up is an option that others have done.

As native Appalachians, my husband and I have a deep love for this region and its people and the tradition of hospitality.  We are both artists of sorts--I'm a freelance writer/reporter and he is a rock 'n roll keyboard player and works in the local school system. And we manage a herd of dairy goats, mostly LaMancha breed. All with names and personalities. Our place is about 15-20  minutes off off I-77. We're close to the notable ""Back of the Dragon"" motorcycle routes. And very close to some beautiful backroad bicycle routes. The scenery is beautiful all seasons of the year but especially the fall. We hope you'll visit!

 As for the goats, they are ""the greatest entertainers and the greatest time wasters"" as my dad used to say. He was a vet and built the house as a home and office. So it has a sort of historic/museum feel in certain sections. 

We don't guarantee food as part of our Airbnb listing,  but I love to cook and if I'm cooking, you're welcome to join us if you don't have other plans. 

Last but not least, we  love to know a little about our guests beforehand so PLEASE make sure you fill out the ""Describe Yourself"" questions under the Airbnb profile section to speed along the booking process.

Safe travels!","257 Reviews","Identity verified","Connie","false","true","https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/770673","770673","true",,,,"2","Joined in July 2011","https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/770673/profile_pic/1309661023/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_large","100%","within a day","Connie","https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/770673/profile_pic/1309661023/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","5","0","70","Accuracy","4.9","0.9880000000000001","10","Communication","5.0","0.998","10","Cleanliness","4.9","0.986","10","Location","4.9","0.986","10","Check-in","5.0","0.994","10","Value","4.9","0.9880000000000001","10","4.97","language_country","Private room in home","private_room","8","4","9","46","available_amenities","","Amenities",,,,,,"Guests have access to the piano/parlor room for relaxing.

I'm in and out of the shared spaces but your bed and bath are always private. I do enjoy interacting with guests but I'm also happy to leave you to your own privacy.

Please have the the Airbnb ""describe yourself"" profile questions filled out (type traveler you are, etc) before you request to book. Also, the local (county) occupancy tax is included in the room price and won't be collected when you arrive. Hope to see you soon!","Please do not wear/use any fragranced personal products (perfumed body sprays, colognes, lotions, shampoos, etc). It can be a real problem for both host and other guests who are migraine-prone or health sensitive. Also very hard for housekeeping to remove from linens. I provide fragrance-free shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, shave cream, lotion, and soap and deodorant that you're MORE than welcome to use!  If you have any questions, just ask. And if you need any other non-fragranced items (detergent, etc) just ask. NOTE: If your stay is over a Saturday, checkout is 9 a.m. Sunday, but any other day it's 10 a.m. as listed. The rules about goats, gates to use, feeding goats, etc., vary with the seasons. Just ask me.","I'm in and out of the shared spaces but your bed and bath are always private.

Whether visiting the beautiful mountains to bike or hike the Creeper Trail, sightseeing in the historical Abingdon or Bristol area, attending a game at E&H or just passing through to another destination, our goal is to provide a warm and welcoming home for your getaway. Resting on an acre of land and right off I 81 enjoy your stay in our cozy, country cottage.

The cottage sits on the corner of our family farm. It faces the road and is backed by open farmland. There is a private driveway for parking your car. A stone path leads from the driveway up 4 steps onto a covered porch. The front door has a keyless entry for your convenience. 

* The cottage entry is also accessible from a covered porch on the opposite side of the home with only one step off the grass. The entry door is not keyless. Please let us know if we can accommodate you with access.

When you enter the cottage, you will see that the living, kitchen, and dining area are open concept with a 13 ft. ceiling. We hope you will find this space warm and inviting with an exposed wood beam and large chandelier. The furniture is all new and carefully selected for the charm and most importantly comfort. There is a 43” Smart TV with Netflix in the living area and free Wi-Fi. The full kitchen area is truly open to the rest of the space and is equipped with everything you'd need to make delicious meals.

Entering the hallway from the living area, you will find the bathroom on the left. It features classic gray and white décor. The tub/shower is surrounded by subway wall tiles and a rain shower water fixture provides a great morning shower. The bathroom cabinets house enough towels, washcloths, bathmats, hairdryer, soap, shampoo, conditioner, and lotion for your stay at the cottage.

At the end of the hallway, double doors enclose the full-size washer and dryer. The laundry area also has an ironing board and iron, detergent, and dryer sheets.

The cottage has 2 separate bedrooms. Bedroom one is bright and sunny with a queen-size bed and a new memory foam mattress.  Bedroom two, painted a restful mountain blue has 2 twin-size beds and new memory foam mattresses. Both bedrooms are equipped with sheets, blankets, extra pillows, and luggage stands. There are closets in both bedrooms with plenty of storage and hangers for your clothing. There is also a portable crib available. 

With land surrounding the cottage and big trees providing shade, kids will enjoy playing outside, so bring your favorite outside games. There is a large covered porch with 2 rocking chairs. In the future, we plan to screen in the porch and add an outside entertainment area. 

Right off an interstate 81 exit, and 0.3 miles down the road our cottage is a very convenient location for just a one-night stay or an entire week or more. Please keep in mind that you will hear traffic noise from the interstate while outside. Extra construction measures were taken to provide a house that is quiet inside both day and night.

If you have special requests for your stay, just ask and we will try to accommodate.

This beautiful historic mansion was constructed in 1859 by John Warfield Johnston, a Virginia Senator, and Judge of Tazewell County. The home is situated on a 3.16-acre lot and is conveniently located within walking distance of the Tazewell Main Street area. The Johnston family was very well known in Virginia for their achievements and built the home to display these accomplishments. 

John, his wife Nicketti and son George lived in the home until it was purchased by John C. Hopkins and wife Elizabeth during the Civil War. Following the war, Colonel Andrew Jackson May (“Jack”) purchased the home. Jack May was thought of as one of Tazewell County’s best known military heroes who played a significant role in the Civil War and helped retain control of the Virginia-Tennessee Railroad. May lived in the mansion with first wife Matilda May, who sadly passed away. Jack remarried Nelle Bly and had a son Colonel May. Nelle remained in the home and turned it into a school for a couple of years before it was sold to the longest owners on record, A.Z. Litz and wife Etta V. Stauber. 

While the mansion has changed ownership over the years, John Warfield Johnston’s home of grandeur remains the same over 160 years later! 

The Litz Mansion Room #1 - The Litz Suite

The Litz Suite pays homage to A.Z. Litz, in which the mansion as we know it today is named. The cozy bedroom features a queen-sized bed, fireplace, and most importantly a private on suite. The on suite is the main attraction here. Newly renovated with beautiful white tile, large glass shower, sunflower shower head and travertine corner seat, make this room a guest favorite. Located downstairs with easy access to the kitchen, dining room, living room and game room. Perfect for couples or guests that enjoy a little more privacy.","HOUSE RULES & OCCUPANCY:

Quite neighborhood with two miles of walking trails, through the woods, on our property.
In St. Paul, Va. just about 7 miles away is the Sugar Hills ATV and hiking trails, and the newly remodeled ""Western Front"" with a nice Restaurant. Sugar Hill Brewery is also a great place to eat and experience local beer. 
The Hidden Valley Lake Area offers hiking, boating and fishing, and is just a few miles away. Fifteen- twenty miles away is The Channels, a majestic sandstone formation that is over 400-million years old. Great Hike !  The ""Devils Bath Tub"" is not to far away and a must see. The Pinnacle Natural Area Reserve is also very close and quite spectacular. The town of Abingdon (18 miles away) is a great little town with some excellent restaurants,  Wolf Hills Brewing Company, The Creeper Trail, The Barter Theater (state theater of Virginia!), biking and walking trails, festivals, and much more.

Please note - Due to the coronavirus I am leaving 1 day between reservations for my safety and the safety of my guests. 
 
Raven Ridge is a mountain top retreat in a natural rhododendron and azalea garden on 100 acres with spectacular views of three states. Spectacular spring blooms and wonderful leaf viewing in the fall. Borders and overlooks the 4,800 acre Channels State Forest. The Clinch Mountain Hiking Trail crosses the property, with access to the Channels, a unique rock formation on top of Clinch Mountain that is a popular hiking destination. The property is listed on the Virginia Birding and wildlife trail, with abundant wildlife and excellent birding. Raven Ridge is located just off the Trans America 76 cross county bike route.

 The Lodge has two bedrooms with queen beds and a couch that converts to a full bed in the living area. The kitchen is fully equipped with a six burner deluxe range. The  marble tiled bath includes a claw foot bathtub. There is an outside hot tub available for soaking under the stars. Heat is provided by a soapstone wood stove with glass doors. In the colder months, the beds are made up with electric blankets to keep you cozy and warm. Numerous porches are great for viewing the scenery or just lounging around.

Although the property has a Saltville address, it is actually located north of the town of Abingdon, and southwest of Lebanon.

Please note that in case of light snow,  a four wheel drive vehicle is recommended for access. If there is a heavy snow (more than a couple of inches), access may not be possible. We don't get a lot of snow, but it is always possible in the winter months. All that being said, Raven Ridge is incredibly beautiful in the snow. 

There is a two night minimum stay. Sorry, pets are not allowed at Raven Ridge, due to the allergies of some of my guests. Although my standard check in time is after 3 PM, I can sometimes accommodate earlier check in.  depending on my schedule. Late checkout may be available as well.

our secluded mountaintop cabin getaway. Tucked away in the Blue Ridge Mountains bordering Jefferson National Forest, this cabin is a cozy retreat with dynamite panoramic views. Spend your time sitting on the porch swing overlooking the Appalachian Mountain countryside. Glimpse the four highest peaks in Virginia, watch the hawks and eagles soar at eye level, and enjoy nature at its best.

Inside the cabin, you will find: 
-A small but fully outfitted kitchen with refrigerator, stove, oven, microwave, toaster, coffeemaker, dishes, utensils, pots and pans.
-Living room with flat screen TV connected to Dish Network satellite with all the network stations as well as Showtime, Cinemax, Starz, and many more.
-Unfortunately, we DO NOT provide internet at this time. However cell phone reception and data usage is confirmed to work well for U.S. Cellular and Verizon plans. (We do not have any knowledge of how well other carriers will work at this time.)
-One full bathroom with shower and washer/dryer located on the ground floor adjacent to the kitchen.
-Heating via baseboard heat.
-Upstairs there are two small bedroom spaces; one bedroom with queen bed and the other bedroom with two twin beds. There are NO DOORS separating the bedrooms from each other or the staircase.
-We will provide a starter amount of toilet paper, paper towels, trash bags, dish soap, hand soap, and shampoo, however for longer stays you may need to purchase additional supplies.

Outside the cabin, you will find:
-Front porch with swing and two rocking chairs.
-Picnic shelter with picnic table and gas barbecue grill.
-Forested walking path along the ridge behind the cabin.
-Scenic views of the countryside.  You may spot some of the local wildlife including white tailed deer, wild turkey, raccoons, possums, hawks, and eagles. Although not as commonly seen, black bears, coyote, foxes, and snakes also live in the area.

Also of note:
-The drive to the property is somewhat of an adventure in of itself. You will be driving through curvy rural farmland roads with livestock including cows, sheep, horses, goats, and chickens in various fields. Please be cautious while driving; it is very common for livestock and/or wildlife to be in the road! You will be on paved road for the majority of the trip, but toward the end, this changes to a one lane gravel road as you climb up the mountain. The driveway to the cabin is steep, so we recommend front wheel or 4-wheel drive vehicles.
-During winter months, reservations may be subject to cancellation due to safety concerns in the event of snow or ice on the road.
-There are 4 steps up to the front porch, and there are 13 somewhat narrow steps inside up to the second floor bedrooms.
-There is a cable gate (essentially a cable across the driveway) with combination padlock at the driveway entrance and keypad self check-in on the front door. (We will provide the codes and detailed driving directions prior to your stay. We strongly recommend you print this information prior to driving since there may be areas of spotty cell service.)

Entire cabin, picnic shelter, and property is yours for the length of your stay.

I give my guests their space and privacy, but am readily available by cell phone for texting or calls.

The town of Fries (pronounced ""freeze"") is about 15-20 minutes away from the cabin, along with two nearby access points for the New River Trail. The New River Trail State Park is a linear park running 57 miles including 39 miles that parallels the scenic and historic New River along what had previously been a railroad track. The trail is relatively flat and includes trestle bridges, tunnels, small waterfalls, and other beautiful woodland scenery enjoyable to hikers, bikers, and horseback riders of all ages.

The nearest stores for groceries and supplies would be the Star Market (~15 minutes) and Dollar General Store (~20 minutes) in Fries, VA. There are larger grocery stores and a Super Wal-Mart located in Galax, VA (~35 minutes). We would recommend picking up supplies on your way to the cabin to save time.

About 20 minutes away, across from one of the more scenic New River Trail access points, you will find ""New River Outdoor Adventures."" This is a local company that provides shuttle services and rentals for canoes, kayaks, tubes, biking, fishing, etc. They also sell live bait and tackle for all your fishing needs, as well as fishing and hunting licenses (either short or long term). If you call (276)237-TUBE(8823) they will customize whatever adventure you might want for your group.

The city of Galax is about a 30 minute drive. Within Galax, you will find many restaurants, fast food options, antique stores, a quaint walkable downtown area, a small movie theater, bowling alley, and of course Super Wal-Mart, among other amenities.

Galax also happens to be home to the largest and oldest running Old Time Bluegrass Fiddler’s Convention, which takes place annually in August since 1935. But don't worry, the entire Appalachian region is known for Bluegrass and traditional ""old-timey"" music which can be enjoyed year-round. The Rex Theater in Galax, VA hosts weekly live music and other special events. The Fries historic theater in Fries, VA also hosts weekly Thursday night Bluegrass ""jam sessions"" and other special events. The wonderful Blue Ridge Music Center can be found on the Blue Ridge Parkway at Milepost 213. This facility includes a large outdoor amphitheater with summer concert series, an award winning music museum of old-time music, and daily display of free music from local musicians.

Access to the Blue Ridge Parkway is only 22 miles away, or about a 35 minute drive. The Blue Ridge Parkway runs 469 miles through Virginia and North Carolina and is one of the most visited properties of the National Park System. The Parkway offers something for everyone including scenic drives, mountain views, biking/hiking/equestrian trails, waterfalls and swimming holes, historic farmsteads and museums, cultural exhibits, and much more.

Grayson Highlands State Park is a longer trek, about 45 miles (or ~70 minutes) drive away from the cabin. This park serves as gateway to the state’s highest peak, Mount Rogers, as well as the Appalachian Trail and the Grayson Highlands. The park offers hiking trails, biking trails, horse riding trails, bouldering, fishing, boating, and the chance to encounter wild ponies.

Previous guests have reported good cellular service at the cabin with Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and US Cellular.  There is no internet service, but there is Dish Network TV  with many channels to choose from.","-No shoes in the house would be greatly appreciated.
-May not be suitable for toddlers or small children. There is no door or safety gate at the top of the stairs which could be hazardous for small children. There are no special child safety features or childcare items (e.g. crib, playpen) provided. There are no railings on the front porch to prevent anyone from falling off.
-Please make sure both doors to the cabin are locked and also the cable gate for the driveway must be locked upon checkout.

There is no internet service, but there is Dish Network TV  with many channels to choose from.","Inside the cabin, you will find: 
-A small but fully outfitted kitchen with refrigerator, stove, oven, microwave, toaster, coffeemaker, dishes, utensils, pots and pans.
-Living room with flat screen TV connected to Dish Network satellite with all the network stations as well as Showtime, Cinemax, Starz, and many more.

Also of note:
-The drive to the property is somewhat of an adventure in of itself. You will be driving through curvy rural farmland roads with livestock including cows, sheep, horses, goats, and chickens in various fields. Please be cautious while driving; it is very common for livestock and/or wildlife to be in the road!

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. No parties or events may be held at the Loft or on the property. 
2. No overnight guests other than those registered and approved when making the reservation online. If you are expecting visitors for a short period of time during your stay, please let your hosts know.
3. No pets are permitted without prior permission and with an additional pet charge of $25 per pet (maximum one large dog or two small dogs). Sorry, no cats are permitted ever. We have four (friendly) dogs so we will need to coordinate yard usage to avoid any possible problems. Please clean up after your pet! Pets may not be left unattended for more than 2 hours and must be in a kennel/travel carrier. If you need assistance finding a dog-sitter please contact your hosts ahead of time.
4. Trash cans and bags are provided in the Loft (under the sink in the kitchen and bathroom). If the cans get full during your stay, please take the trash out and put in one of the trash cans in, or by, the driveway. No need to take out the trash at the end of your stay.
5. No hair dying or coloring is permitted in the Loft.
6. We do not have child safety features; children are welcome if you accept liability and are comfortable knowing we have no child proofing along with many stairs.
7. Minors under the age of 18 must be accompanied, in person AT ALL TIMES, by an adult over 21. You must be 21 to book a reservation at the Loft.
8. The antler hooks by the door will not hold heavy loads. Please only hang light jackets and clothing on them.
9. Please clean your boots/shoes as well as you can before entering the building and use the boot tray upstairs by the door for your boots and shoes.
10. Please do not block neighbor’s driveways, including the apartment’s next door. We will do what we can to help you with parking (including our driveway and street parking in front of our house). Please let us know if you’re traveling with a trailer so we can help you plan for parking.
11. If you would like to sit outside, you are welcome to use the camp chairs at the bottom of the stairs. If it is raining or too sunny, feel free to sit under the carport by the house. If we are parked there, just send us a message during daytime hours (9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) and we’ll move our car: we want you to enjoy your stay! You can also sit in the backyard but be aware that our dogs will occasionally need to be let out. If you are using the yard and/or grill, we will check with you before letting out the dogs. When sitting outside after 9 p.m. please try to keep the noise down so as not to disturb the residents and neighbors.
12. Do not go out on the roof. While it looks like a great place to hang out, it’s not safe for people and walking on the shingles are likely to cause damage.
13. Without exception, no smoking, vaping or marijuana usage inside the Loft. Please don’t think it can be covered up, it cannot. We have to extensively clean to remove the contaminant before other guests can arrive. Neutralizing this contaminant inside requires a $100 minimum service fee. Feel free to step outside in the back yard and quietly enjoy a tobacco smoke or vape; you'll just need to police your butts.
14. Before you leave, please wash any dishes that you used. Clean dishes can be left in the drainer to dry and we’ll put them away.
15. No need to strip the bed or pile up used towels and washcloths upon departure but during your stay, please hang wet towels and washcloths on the towel racks, shower curtain rod or side of the bathtub.
16. Please lock the door at the bottom of the steps whenever you leave the premises, including your departure.

The Foggy Mountain Loft has the feel of a mountain hideaway but in town, close to where you want to play & eat. There's a private entrance to this simple guest loft above the garage behind our home. You'll find a basic kitchenette, full bathroom, Roku TV and WiFi. At over 50 years old, the Loft shows its age with multiple layers of paint and years of cosmetic repairs, but it has been recently renovated to create a safe, clean & comfortable space.

The Foggy Mountain Loft is a single L-shaped room which has a double bed, futon couch, and a full bathroom with bathtub and shower. You can use our Adirondack chairs to spend time outside or stay in and watch your streaming apps on the Roku TV. There isn't a stove or oven in the Loft but there is a microwave, coffee maker, hot water kettle, toaster, air fryer and electric skillet for simple food preparation, and a grill in the garage you can use upon request.  There are also many great restaurants in Logan just a few minutes away.

Foggy Mountain Loft is on a residential street near town with free on-street parking. If you're towing a trailer, we'll try to save the spaces in front of the house for you with prior arrangement or you can use our driveway. You'll have a private entrance to the Loft at the end of the driveway with access through a digital keypad deadbolt lock.

We're available during your stay for assistance or to answer questions but you'll have as much privacy as you're looking for.

There are many places to eat in Logan and a lot of things to do:

Chief Logan State Park: 5.6 miles
Chief Logan Recreation Center: 8.2 miles
Dunks Body Shop (Gym): 12.5 miles
H & M Bearwallow Trail connector: 1 mile
H & M Bearwallow Trailhead: 4.1 miles
H & M Rockhouse Trailhead: 13.8 miles
H & M Buffalo Mountain Trailhead: 28 miles
H & M Devil Anse Trailhead: 34.6 miles

Gas station (which usually has the cheapest gas in Logan) is just about a mile away (just past the coffee house and bakery...)!

On street parking is easy to find near Foggy Mountain Loft. If you're raveling with a trailer you'll be able to find a spot within a couple blocks of the Loft. With prior arrangement, guests traveling with a trailer can have the parking spaces in front of  our house saved by us until their arrival or can park in the driveway (pulling truck into carport, there's room for a trailer with one ATV).

This is a 2nd floor loft with a narrow staircase, so you'll need to keep an eye on small children and keep in mind your own ability to climb stairs.","1. No parties or events may be held at the Loft or on the property. 
2. No overnight guests other than those registered and approved when making the reservation online. If you are expecting visitors for a short period of time during your stay, please let your hosts know.
3. No pets are permitted without prior permission and with an additional pet charge of $25 per pet (maximum one large dog or two small dogs). Sorry, no cats are permitted ever. We have four (friendly) dogs so we will need to coordinate yard usage to avoid any possible problems. Please clean up after your pet! Pets may not be left unattended for more than 2 hours and must be in a kennel/travel carrier. If you need assistance finding a dog-sitter please contact your hosts ahead of time.
4. Trash cans and bags are provided in the Loft (under the sink in the kitchen and bathroom). If the cans get full during your stay, please take the trash out and put in one of the trash cans in, or by, the driveway. No need to take out the trash at the end of your stay.
5. No hair dying or coloring is permitted in the Loft.
6. We do not have child safety features; children are welcome if you accept liability and are comfortable knowing we have no child proofing along with many stairs.
7. Minors under the age of 18 must be accompanied, in person AT ALL TIMES, by an adult over 21. You must be 21 to book a reservation at the Loft.
8. The antler hooks by the door will not hold heavy loads. Please only hang light jackets and clothing on them.
9. Please clean your boots/shoes as well as you can before entering the building and use the boot tray upstairs by the door for your boots and shoes.
10. Please do not block neighbor’s driveways, including the apartment’s next door. We will do what we can to help you with parking (including our driveway and street parking in front of our house). Please let us know if you’re traveling with a trailer so we can help you plan for parking.
11. If you would like to sit outside, you are welcome to use the camp chairs at the bottom of the stairs. If it is raining or too sunny, feel free to sit under the carport by the house. If we are parked there, just send us a message during daytime hours (9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) and we’ll move our car: we want you to enjoy your stay! You can also sit in the backyard but be aware that our dogs will occasionally need to be let out. If you are using the yard and/or grill, we will check with you before letting out the dogs. When sitting outside after 9 p.m. please try to keep the noise down so as not to disturb the residents and neighbors.
12. Do not go out on the roof. While it looks like a great place to hang out, it’s not safe for people and walking on the shingles are likely to cause damage.
13. Without exception, no smoking, vaping or marijuana usage inside the Loft. Please don’t think it can be covered up, it cannot. We have to extensively clean to remove the contaminant before other guests can arrive. Neutralizing this contaminant inside requires a $100 minimum service fee. Feel free to step outside in the back yard and quietly enjoy a tobacco smoke or vape; you'll just need to police your butts.
14. Before you leave, please wash any dishes that you used. Clean dishes can be left in the drainer to dry and we’ll put them away.
15. No need to strip the bed or pile up used towels and washcloths upon departure but during your stay, please hang wet towels and washcloths on the towel racks, shower curtain rod or side of the bathtub.
16. Please lock the door at the bottom of the steps whenever you leave the premises, including your departure.","We're available during your stay for assistance or to answer questions but you'll have as much privacy as you're looking for.","en","English","Foggy Mountain Loft near Hatfield & McCoy Trails","There are many places to eat in Logan and a lot of things to do:

This gem is at the epicenter of shops, restaurants and nightlife!  Park upon arrival and enjoy all our quaint town offers within walking distance- The Barter Theatre, The Virginia Creeper Trail, The Tavern, Jack's 128 Pecan, Foresta, Summers Rooftop/Cellar, Rain, The Girl and The Raven, Wolf Hills Brewery, and much, much more- and it was literally built over a spring!

We are super Covid cleaning conscious. Additionally,  several of the restaurants within a couple blocks walk have outdoor dining/seating and the Creeper trailhead is 3 blocks away.  There is a mudroom with a bike rack for 5 bikes, and even a full sized mtn bike on-site for your convenience. You can seriously mitigate any Covid risks if you should choose to by enjoying great food, good drink, and exercise outdoors and steps away from the cottage.  Across the street from The Old Springhouse is a public park with lots of fun things for the kids and adults alike- including a covered picnic area and barbeque grill. The cottage also sits on Towne Creek with its famous resident Mallards!  Be careful though, as the creek runs thru town and is prone to have glass or debris in it. Wear shoes if wading!  There is a private driveway at the cottage but if you have more than one car, feel free to park across the street at the park.  Legend has it the park was home to the main town spring from which everyone got their drinking water.

Entire home and property including creek- enjoy but wear shoes if wading in creek to be safe.

You will have coded access to the house but we live just two blocks away so let us know if you need anything!

Literally you are within steps of the finest restaurants and theater that our area has to offer.  The renowned Highlands Festival takes place just at the top of the hill as well as Plum Alley Days and as mentioned, The Creeper trail-head and bike shops are a few blocks away. We are super Covid cleaning conscious. Additionally,  several of the restaurants within a couple blocks walk have outdoor dining/seating and the Creeper trailhead is 3 blocks away. You can seriously mitigate any Covid risks if you should choose to by enjoying great food, good drink, and exercize outdoors and steps away from the cottage. Hope to see you soon. Enjoy and stay safe!

Unless you are heading to the River, the Lake, or the AT, you can literally park your car and not move it until checkout- the best location around!

There is a firehouse across the street but the responders are VERY sympathetic to local residents and don't turn on their sirens until they are past the house and get on main street.  Also, Abingdon has a train track running the length of town- any house in town is “close”.  Several trains run during the course of the day, FYI.","Please be respectful and clean- do dishes if you use them, leave muddy shoes at back door... you know, treat it as if it were your own. ;)","You will have coded access to the house but we live just two blocks away so let us know if you need anything!","en","English","The Olde Springhouse - Downtown, Abingdon","Literally you are within steps of the finest restaurants and theater that our area has to offer.

Recent guest commentary: “We thoroughly enjoyed staying in your loft. So peaceful and quiet, with all the comforts of home… It’s a little diamond!” – June 7, 2021

When you first arrive at Fiddlehead Loft, you will see private parking for four cars. Enter the almost entirely enclosed & fenced yard, walk up the graveled path, and ascend the outside staircase to the second-floor loft. You’ll find yourself on a spacious covered porch with plenty of seating, including several chairs and a café table set that’s perfect for morning coffee or a snack (Brand new hammock on the way!)

Upon entering the loft, the first thing you’ll notice is the combination of warm tones and light walls with several windows letting in ample light. The stylish and modern décor throughout features greens and muted yellows, grays and browns, creams and blacks, all accented with natural fibers and live plants. This first room is a great room that encompasses a kitchen and dining area on one side and a living room on the other. A mini-split air conditioner is controlled from the living room but heats and cools the whole space.

In the living room to the right sits a comfy leather sofa and several oversized sectional chairs. A 50-inch smart TV and a bookcase filled with games, books, and magazines are ready for your relaxation. Or, if work is on the schedule, you can make use of the workspace separating the kitchen/dining area and living room. The loft is equipped with Wi-Fi. 

To the left is a beautiful modern kitchen and dining area. The table seats four (with room for two more at the workstation). The kitchen is filled with everything you’ll need to cook and serve, including a full-sized range and fridge, microwave, and coffeemaker. Plentiful cabinet and drawer space holds plate- and glassware, serving pieces, cutlery, utensils, and other small appliances, along with pots and pans. There’s also room for you to tuck away any food you purchase for your stay.

Moving through the great room toward the back of the loft space, you find on your right a lovely bathroom featuring a glass-enclosed full bath/shower combo. Brushed gold and black accents complement the white walls and gorgeous wallpaper, and a repurposed table creates the perfect vanity and sink space. The bathroom is stocked with plenty of towels and toilet paper for your stay.

Directly across from the bathroom sits an enclosed space with a stacked washer and dryer for your laundry needs.

Last, you’ll find two bedrooms in the back of the loft. The bright, naturally lit master bedroom sits to the right. A queen bed with a new memory-foam mattress is covered in soft, rich bedding, while two bedside tables sit ready to hold your current book, glasses, or nighttime toiletries. Double sconces mean you won’t have to fight with your bedmate over late-night reading. A bench at the foot of the bed is the perfect space for putting on your shoes or setting bags, while a full-sized dresser and closet await your clothes and accessories.

The cozy second bedroom sits in the back left corner of the loft. Glass French doors allow plenty of light into the space even when the doors are closed, but a pull-down shade provides privacy and darkness at night. This room contains a sturdy bunkbed set holding two double-sized mattresses with comfy bedding. There’s plenty of space to store your belongings and sconce lighting for both beds.

Filled with beautiful accents and thoughtful touches throughout, Fiddlehead Loft is the perfect home away from home for your long- or short-term travel needs. 

Notes:
•	A well-behaved and housetrained dog is welcome with a $20 nonrefundable fee per week ($10 per week for a second dog) to be collected in a separate payment. Please let us know when you book that you will be bringing a dog, so we can arrange payment. Dogs must be crated when left alone in the loft.
•	Fiddlehead Loft, although having the impression of being it's own structure, is located on the back of a building over a set of office suites (which are entered through the front of the building on a completely different side). They are almost always empty during the day and it remains very quiet. At night, the lower lever is most assuredly vacant, so you are alone in the building. 
•	Like many towns and cities in Virginia, Glade Spring is an historic railroad town, and a set of tracks does go through nearby. But the sounds are buffered and muted indoors, and guests report no issues. However, if you are particularly sensitive to outside sounds, you may wish to look elsewhere. 
•	Fiddlehead Loft is reached by a set of outdoor stairs to the second story. Those with mobility concerns may want to consider another property.

I am respectful of your privacy and will not be onsite during your stay, but I am happy to help in any way and live only a short distance if needed. Renters have full access to me via text or phone.

**Please note the loft is accessed from a side street to the back of the property.**

Glade Spring, Virginia
Located in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Southwest Virginia, Glade Spring is a quaint and peaceful little town boasting an historic square listed on the National Register of Historic Places. With easy access to the interstate and several restaurants and gas stations, it’s a convenient stop for travelers, especially those coming to the area for its many outdoor activities.

Fiddlehead Loft is located:

• 1.4 miles from I-81 on a quiet side street off Glade Spring’s historic town square. 
• 2 miles from the rails-to-trails gem The Salt Trail, the perfect place for a peaceful walk, bike, or horse ride in nature.
• 5 minutes from charming Emory, the home of beautiful Emory & Henry College. (Fiddlehead Loft is conveniently located for game-day lodging!)
• 10 mins from historic Abingdon with numerous excellent restaurants and shops, an award-winning winery, several coffeehouses, a hip brewery, and the world-renowned Barter Theatre.
• 15 mins from playful Damascus, known as Trail Town, USA. Experience the famous Creeper Trail bike ride off White Top Mountain or hop on a beautiful Virginia section of the Appalachian Trail.
• 30 minutes from the famous State Street of Bristol, VA-TN, with a variety of restaurants, shops, breweries, the 24-hour Blackbird Bakery, and the Birthplace of Country Music Museum. Don’t forget the requisite selfie of yourself standing with one foot in Virginia and one in Tennessee!
• Central to many outdoor adventure opportunities in our Blue Ridge Mountains, such as hiking in Mount Rogers National Recreation Area (look for the famous wild ponies), biking the Creeper Trail, or boating on gorgeous South Holston Lake.

** If you are looking for a last minute place to stay for the night, please feel free to send a request. I will do all I can to try to work it out.


** If you see there is only one available night left on a given weekend and you wish to stay only that one night, please contact me.

This 53-acre property borders the Jefferson National Forest with private trails in a park like setting with small waterfalls throughout the property. An unparalleled place to relax from the daily grind but only a short, 15-minute drive to Wytheville, VA.

We are pet friendly with lots of room for you four-legged love ones to explore.
We charge a pet fee of $25 for the first pet per stay and $10 for each additional pet per stay. 
The pet fee is collected separately through AirBNB after the cabin is booked.

Water:  We are in a beautiful, rural location with well water; it has a sulphur smell to it.  Although, completely safe to drink and bathe in it has a strong smell many people are not accustomed to this so I like to let guests know upfront.  I leave a gallon of water in the cabin along with the breakfast basket but I always suggest guests bring plenty of water to cook with.

Wi-Fi: As mentioned above, this is a rural location which is great to decompress and find peace and quiet but high speed internet isn’t available in this area. We provide satellite internet, so guests can use Wi-Fi texting and calling (dependent on your cell provider- cell phone service is very limited), check emails and surf the web but streaming Netflix and downloading music unfortunately don’t work.  We have the highest amount of gigabytes available with HughesNet Satellite but once the data caps are reached(which is easy to do if streaming is tried and continues to buffer) the internet eventually stops.  We ask you to please be conscientious with the internet usage so all our guests are able to use it throughout their stay with us.

This place is so special and we want our guests to love it as much as we do so if there is anything we can do throughout your stay we are happy to help.

We are in a rural location; cell phone service is limited but we do have Hughesnet Satellite wi-fi, it doesn't stream video but allows for surfing the web, answering emails, wi-fi texting and calling(depending on you cell phone carrier plan).

As like many people in rural America we are on a well water system so the water has Sulphur, which is completely safe to drink and bath in but does have a Sulphur smell and is an acquired taste.  We supply a gallon of water but suggest our guests bring extra water for drinking due to the taste.","PLEASE HONOR 10AM CHECK-OUT

new places and trying new foods. We value the learning and personal growth that come with travel, and love sharing our experiences with others. That's why my husband and I decided to create Escape Vacation Rentals, where we can share our personal spaces with others from all over. We believe that travel has the power to broaden our horizons and connect us with people and places we might never have encountered otherwise. We hope you enjoy our little spaces as much as we do!!!

As native Appalachians, my husband and I have a deep love for this region and its people and the tradition of hospitality.  We are both artists of sorts--I'm a freelance writer/reporter and he is a rock 'n roll keyboard player and works in the local school system. And we manage a herd of dairy goats, mostly LaMancha breed. All with names and personalities. Our place is about 15-20  minutes off off I-77. We're close to the notable ""Back of the Dragon"" motorcycle routes. And very close to some beautiful backroad bicycle routes. The scenery is beautiful all seasons of the year but especially the fall. We hope you'll visit!

 As for the goats, they are ""the greatest entertainers and the greatest time wasters"" as my dad used to say. He was a vet and built the house as a home and office. So it has a sort of historic/museum feel in certain sections. 

We don't guarantee food as part of our Airbnb listing,  but I love to cook and if I'm cooking, you're welcome to join us if you don't have other plans. 

Last but not least, we  love to know a little about our guests beforehand so PLEASE make sure you fill out the ""Describe Yourself"" questions under the Airbnb profile section to speed along the booking process.

There's a great little biking road about 1/4 mile from my home that lots of bikers love to ride. About 5 miles away is a great mountain bike trail at the Blfd WV city park. For more serious bikers, there's the Burkes Garden trail. 
For hikers, Lincolnshire Park, about 13 miles away in Tazewell, has features so beautiful you will think you're in the The Hobbit's  ""Shire.""

Located in a gated community called Cove Creek which consists of many  large acre properties and very little development.  Several trails located directly on the property for atv riding and hiking.  The community is atv friendly and also boasts a beautiful creek containing brook trout and picturesque waterfall.  Winterplace , Hatfield Mccoy Trails, and Appalachian trail all only minutes away.

There are many things that make this cabin unique.  First, it's  a  1,200 sq foot 3 bedroom fully equipped cozy cabin property on 18 acres and has breathtaking mountaintop views and private access to our own trails for hiking and ATV'ing.  It's also centrally located to several well known mountain adventure places for White water rafting, Skiiing, ATV'ing, Hiking, and much more.  We moderately priced this so that families, couples, and friend groups alike can take advantage of it.  We have wood logs on the property for the fireplace that can be chopped and usually there is some already there.  While you feel like your in complete solitude at the top of the south side it's nice to know you have easy access to many amenities (grocery stores, restaurants, movie theater, etc) in the city of Bluefield, VA: located just minutes from the bottom of the northside of the mountain.

You have access to the whole cabin and the trails on the property as well as the trail that goes to my brothers property that can be hiked or used by ATV's.  You also have access to the private community waterfall.

We are in florida but have a property manager that is there for housing needs and/or emergencies.  I pride myself of communication and maximizing your experience.  Email or text me for any details anytime.

The cabin is located inside of a gated, sparsely populated community called cove creek.  Guests have access to the Creek which has trout and a beautiful waterfall.  The city of bluefield and Tazewell are mintues away and have many restaurants, grociery stores, and your basic amenities (there's a walmart...lol).  Also within driving distance are great adventure places like the Hatfield Mccoy ATV Trails, Appalachian Trail for hiking, Winter Place ski resort,  AceRaft for white water and many  parks with waterfalls like pipestem and the cascades.  The property itself is 18 acres and has several trails on it for hiking and atv'ing.

If it’s not snowing any car can be used to get up and down the mountain.  However if more then 2-4 inches snow is in the forecast we highly recommend 4 wheel drive.  Also, the driveway can be tough to get up and down if you aren’t use to driving in the mountains.  I can do it in a Prius as long as it’s not snowing but I have experience. Biggest hint is stick to the left side when going up. There is additional parking at the coldesac on top of the driveway if you want to play it safe

*It takes about 15-20 minutes to go up or down the mountain depending on your vehicle, what your towing, and comfortableness in mountain driving.  
*Hatfielld Mccoy trails are about 15-45 minutes from the bottom depending on which trailhead you access.  as of right now you can not access directly by ATV.
*WinterPlace is 39 miles from the bottom of the mountain and takes about 30 minutes.
*5 miles from Appalachian Trail and can actually view the mountain ridge it passes through from the cabin. 
*""The Back og the Dragon"" Trail for motorcycles is close but might have to trailer bikes down the mountain depending if you can ride on the gravel roads.","-you're expected to leave the cabin in clean condition and all trash in bags and dishes washed.  Cleaning lady is not responsible for cleaning up messes, bottles, and other trash left throughout the house and reviews will be given accordingly.
- Special consideration can be given for pets.  Message me individually 
- Accompany children at all times.
- You can smoke outside but please avoid throwing butt's on ground.
- be careful in dry seasons of fires outside.   Put any fire outside completely out with water.   Winds are strong at the top of mountain and can restart your fires that aren’t fully out out and blow embers into dry leaves.   
-  no hunting unless otherwise permitted by owner and properly licensed.
-  no chopping down of live trees or chopping into damaging move trees.   
- lastly, Don't be an idiot.","We are in florida but have a property manager that is there for housing needs and/or emergencies.  I pride myself of communication and maximizing your experience.

That was the deciding decision for hosting the airbnb with brothers - Jamie and Troy with help from everyone else.

I am a retired art teacher from Taylor County WV and Lexington Senior High NC. I live in Thomasville NC with my husband who is also from McDowell County WV.  Besides art, I sew and have an online etsy shop.  My brother Troy, has a house-painting business and lives near Bluefield Va.  Our sister Ann, retired from teaching music and her husband have lived in many areas; they are now retired living in White Sulphur Springs WV.
