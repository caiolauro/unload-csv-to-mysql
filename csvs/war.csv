Rentals exceeding 90 days do not fall under the NC vacation rental management act and are not subject to the same protections adhered to by the NC Vacation Rental Management Act.

Maximum occupancy must be strictly adhered to.  Occupancy count includes children.  Exceeding the occupancy limit set for your unit is ground for immediate eviction.  No exceptions and no refunds!

Accidental Damage Protector & Security Deposits:  The Accidental Damage Protection Plan is included in the advertised total amount and indemnifies you and your family up to $1500 for any accidental damage during your stay. All accidental damage must be reported to our office in writing by the end of renter’s stay in order for Damage Protector to apply.  Damage Protector is a surety contract and is not insurance.  RRR is not an insurer, insurance agent or underwriter.  The Accidental Damage Protection is non refundable.  Damage Protector does NOT cover intentional damage, excessive cleaning, theft, Acts of God, gross negligence, pet damage, utilities, rent, pay for view cable charges, additional costs incurred during stay per renter’s request, or loss of use.  Any intentional property damage or items listed above will be billed to the renter and may be charged to renter’s account or credit card on file without renter’s consent if RRR is unable to contact renter to request authorization.  

A security deposit can be elected in lieu of Accidental Damage Protection.  The cost ranges from $200 to $800 depending on the rental unit.  It is fully refundable by mail within 30 days of departure providing no damages have been made to the unit and the unit has been left tidy (according to our check out procedures) or (less any allowable deductions).  The security deposit can be paid in advance by personal check, money order, certified funds or credit card. Security deposits paid upon arrival must be paid by cash or credit card only. 

A few homes may require an additional security deposit beyond what is required above in this rental agreement.  The renter agrees to reimburse the homeowner for any damages to the property caused by renter that are in excess of, or not covered by Damage Protector or the security deposit.  Such damages shall include reasonable attorney fees and court costs.  The provisions of Article 5, Chapter 42A of the North Carolina General Statutes (Landlord and tenant Duties) are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth.

This is a vacation rental agreement under the North Carolina Vacation Rental Act.  The rights and obligations of the parties to this agreement are defined by law and include unique provisions permitting the disbursement of rent prior to tenancy and expedited eviction of tenants.  Your signature on this agreement, or payment of money, or taking possession of the property after receipt of this agreement, is evidence of your acceptance of the agreement and your intent to use this property for a vacation rental.  Rentals exceeding 90 days do not fall under the NC vacation rental management act and are not subject to the same protections adhered to by the NC Vacation Rental Management Act.

Maximum occupancy must be strictly adhered to.  Occupancy count includes children.  Exceeding the occupancy limit set for your unit is ground for immediate eviction.  No exceptions and no refunds!

Accidental Damage Protector & Security Deposits:  The Accidental Damage Protection Plan is included in the advertised total amount and indemnifies you and your family up to $1500 for any accidental damage during your stay. All accidental damage must be reported to our office in writing by the end of renter’s stay in order for Damage Protector to apply.  Damage Protector is a surety contract and is not insurance.  RRR is not an insurer, insurance agent or underwriter.  The Accidental Damage Protection is non refundable.  Damage Protector does NOT cover intentional damage, excessive cleaning, theft, Acts of God, gross negligence, pet damage, utilities, rent, pay for view cable charges, additional costs incurred during stay per renter’s request, or loss of use.  Any intentional property damage or items listed above will be billed to the renter and may be charged to renter’s account or credit card on file without renter’s consent if RRR is unable to contact renter to request authorization.  

A security deposit can be elected in lieu of Accidental Damage Protection.  The cost ranges from $200 to $800 depending on the rental unit.  It is fully refundable by mail within 30 days of departure providing no damages have been made to the unit and the unit has been left tidy (according to our check out procedures) or (less any allowable deductions).  The security deposit can be paid in advance by personal check, money order, certified funds or credit card. Security deposits paid upon arrival must be paid by cash or credit card only. 

A few homes may require an additional security deposit beyond what is required above in this rental agreement.  The renter agrees to reimburse the homeowner for any damages to the property caused by renter that are in excess of, or not covered by Damage Protector or the security deposit.  Such damages shall include reasonable attorney fees and court costs.  The provisions of Article 5, Chapter 42A of the North Carolina General Statutes (Landlord and tenant Duties) are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth.

That was the deciding decision for hosting the airbnb with brothers - Jamie and Troy with help from everyone else.

I am a retired art teacher from Taylor County WV and Lexington Senior High NC. I live in Thomasville NC with my husband who is also from McDowell County WV.  Besides art, I sew and have an online etsy shop.  My brother Troy, has a house-painting business and lives near Bluefield Va.  Our sister Ann, retired from teaching music and her husband have lived in many areas; they are now retired living in White Sulphur Springs WV.

Room #8 - The Colonel May Room (Shared Bathroom)

The Colonel May room is dedicated to the youngest son of Andrew Jackson and Nelle May. Andrew named his son “Colonel” in hopes to pass along some of the luster and reputation of his own name. This room is fit for a Colonel and styled for one too. With all the furnishings being dark, rich mahogany, and walnut. A favorite talking piece of this room is the beautiful stone capped foot boards. And of course, the guests who stay in this room are in love with the upper porch located just a few steps outside the room door, perfect for enjoying and relaxing.","HOUSE RULES & OCCUPANCY:

Rental of the cottage includes a souvenir fishing permit.  This will give you complete access to the fishing supplies in Ishmael's Tackle Shop.  Ishmael's is located just below the cottage- we'll have it unlocked for you.  We do require that after any photographs, you throw your fish back in the pond. (Swimming is not allowed in the pond.) (Ice skating on the pond is also not allowed.)

We are currently building a pencil museum for Jill's collection.  The pencil museum opens up to our Blackberry Boardwalk.  It's a nice walkway through the edge of the woods near the pond.  It also helps make the blackberries more accessible during season (they're typically ripe in August and you're welcome to help yourself!) Although the museum is still in a construction phase, the Blackberry Boardwalk is complete.

Also, we are located in a very popular area for ATV riders.  We are 38.8 miles to the Pocahontas Trail Head (Hatfield & McCoy ATV & UTV Trails).  You are welcome to use any tools in our garage for maintenance of your ATV or UTV while you are visiting. 

You're free to walk throughout the property, including the gardens.  Please also treat the gardens like a buffet.  You're welcome to eat all of the vegetables and fruit you want while you're here.  You're also welcome to help with any animal chores and gardening (especially fun for kids!) and we love to answer any questions you have.

When it is time for your check-out, you can just walk away!  No cleaning or locking up needed.  We like for folks to be able to completely relax and not worry about any of the details. :-)","human","Stay in the Storybook Cottage at the Holliday Castle!  The Storybook Cottage is a tiny crooked fairytale house located behind our home (which is being converted into a castle!)  Enjoy the view from your private back porch! Close to ski resort!

The Storybook Cottage is a fairytale-inspired tiny crooked house.  The Cottage is located directly behind our house - which is in the process of being converted into a castle. Our property houses apple trees, plum trees, cherry trees, grapevines, peach trees, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, and pear trees- in addition to mass quantities of vegetables. 

In the photographs posted, you'll be able to see more about the property, the placement of the Cottage in relation to the main house, and some of the animals. :-)

In the Cottage, you'll find books, board games, and general whimsy. During the late spring and summer, the front porch opens up into an edible front yard- feel free to help yourself!  The back porch overlooks the pond (beautiful, but not suitable for skating!).  Rental of the cottage comes with access to the fishing supplies located in Ishmael's Tackle Shop.  Ishmael's is located just below the cottage- we keep it unlocked for our guests.  (However, swimming is not allowed in the pond- and when it's frozen over, no skating is allowed either.)

The Cottage is a tiny house, yet still has a lot of amenities!  You have your own private kitchenette, equipped with a sink, mini-fridge, breakfast station (which includes a coffee pot, toaster oven and griddle), a microwave and a table with seats for two.  (Due to the size of this kitchenette, we were unable to include a traditional oven with stovetop. If you have any questions about the kitchenette, please just let us know! ) This kitchenette also includes dishes (mugs, larger cups, plates, bowls and silverware)  and a folding tray for reading or enjoying your meals in bed.  During the warmer season, we provide a retro cooler for your use while fishing or picnicking.

You will also have your own private bathroom with an antique sink and claw foot tub (with shower).  We provide you with towels, washcloths, soap, shampoo, conditioner, bubble bath and a hair dryer. (If you've forgotten anything else, just let us know- we probably have extras!)

The Cottage also has, what we call, a ""mud room.""  It's a small room where you'll find a bench and a picnic basket (during season).  During the holidays, the mudroom is decked out with a Christmas tree. The mudroom is intended as a place for you to unload, store your umbrella and shed your shoes.  In the winter months, this room is also outfitted with boot warmers.  

The main room houses a queen size bed, a rocking chair, a tv (w/ dvd player), and a dresser (which converts into a lighted desk.) We also provide you with an iron and ironing board.  There is not a closet; however, there is a hook on the door for hanging your garment bag. The bedding is composed of two down alternative pillows, two ""SpaLuxury"" pillows, and two 100% cotton blankets.  There are three separate heaters located throughout the cottage. There is also a window air conditioner. The main room/bedroom overlooks the pond with an entire wall of windows (don't worry- there are room-darkening curtains if you prefer to sleep in!)  

If you would like to bring your child(ren), please send me a message beforehand.  I am sure that a small air mattress will fit beside the queen size bed (and I will prepare it for you!), but I want to share exact dimensions with you to ensure you'll be pleased with the layout of the room. Also, if you're bringing young children, please let me know!  I will ensure the cottage is stocked with some age-appropriate toys. 

Regarding breakfast, your kitchen will be stocked with a standard brew of coffee, as well as tea bags.  Upon your arrival, you will find a basket of fruit and zucchini bread (or something similar), as well as a couple bottles of water in your fridge. We have decided to leave this welcome/breakfast basket for you so as not to disturb your sleep the next morning.  During the winter months, your kitchen is also stocked with hot cocoa mix.

We currently have a dog, cats, and a chicken.  This past winter has been hard on the animals.  Pumpkin, our pet turkey passed away, as well as our duck, and one of the chickens. This spring (2023), we will be getting baby chickens, ducks and turkeys.

**Update April 2023:  We had a very bad windstorm and a handsome little rooster blew in and has fallen deeply in love with our Chicken Little.  They have moved into Pumpkin's old house and are inseparable. We realize he's an early riser and not all of us are--- so we are now providing ear plugs for each guest in the cottage (just in case.)

The entire Cottage is for your use.  

Rental of the cottage includes a souvenir fishing permit.  This will give you complete access to the fishing supplies in Ishmael's Tackle Shop.  Ishmael's is located just below the cottage- we'll have it unlocked for you.  We do require that after any photographs, you throw your fish back in the pond. (Swimming is not allowed in the pond.)

You will see us on the property.  We have five children living here, ranging in age from seven to eighteen.  Don't worry- they will not bother you at all- but you will probably see them outside playing.  If you need anything, I am a stay-at-home mom and am easily accessible during the day.  I can frequently be found in the kitchen, our library or the greenhouse.  We dearly love to show folks around our place and answer any questions you may have about our home, gardens, animals and/or the area.

We are less than a mile from Winterplace Ski Resort, Dollar General, Exxon and Little General Gas Stations, Ski Barn, and the Ghent Post Office.  We are almost exactly halfway between Princeton, WV and Beckley, WV.  We are 17 miles from Beckley and 22 miles from Princeton.

**Important to note:  We are a castle-in-progress, so you will see construction materials in the common areas.  Believe me, we're working as fast as we can! :-) Thank you for understanding!","The Storybook Cottage is a fairytale-inspired tiny crooked house.  The Cottage is located directly behind our house - which is in the process of being converted into a castle. Our property houses apple trees, plum trees, cherry trees, grapevines, peach trees, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, and pear trees- in addition to mass quantities of vegetables. 

In the photographs posted, you'll be able to see more about the property, the placement of the Cottage in relation to the main house, and some of the animals. :-)

In the Cottage, you'll find books, board games, and general whimsy. During the late spring and summer, the front porch opens up into an edible front yard- feel free to help yourself!  The back porch overlooks the pond (beautiful, but not suitable for skating!).  Rental of the cottage comes with access to the fishing supplies located in Ishmael's Tackle Shop.  Ishmael's is located just below the cottage- we keep it unlocked for our guests.  (However, swimming is not allowed in the pond- and when it's frozen over, no skating is allowed either.)

The Cottage is a tiny house, yet still has a lot of amenities!  You have your own private kitchenette, equipped with a sink, mini-fridge, breakfast station (which includes a coffee pot, toaster oven and griddle), a microwave and a table with seats for two.  (Due to the size of this kitchenette, we were unable to include a traditional oven with stovetop. If you have any questions about the kitchenette, please just let us know! ) This kitchenette also includes dishes (mugs, larger cups, plates, bowls and silverware)  and a folding tray for reading or enjoying your meals in bed.  During the warmer season, we provide a retro cooler for your use while fishing or picnicking.

You will also have your own private bathroom with an antique sink and claw foot tub (with shower).  We provide you with towels, washcloths, soap, shampoo, conditioner, bubble bath and a hair dryer. (If you've forgotten anything else, just let us know- we probably have extras!)

The Cottage also has, what we call, a ""mud room.""  It's a small room where you'll find a bench and a picnic basket (during season).  During the holidays, the mudroom is decked out with a Christmas tree. The mudroom is intended as a place for you to unload, store your umbrella and shed your shoes.  In the winter months, this room is also outfitted with boot warmers.  

The main room houses a queen size bed, a rocking chair, a tv (w/ dvd player), and a dresser (which converts into a lighted desk.) We also provide you with an iron and ironing board.  There is not a closet; however, there is a hook on the door for hanging your garment bag. The bedding is composed of two down alternative pillows, two ""SpaLuxury"" pillows, and two 100% cotton blankets.  There are three separate heaters located throughout the cottage. There is also a window air conditioner. The main room/bedroom overlooks the pond with an entire wall of windows (don't worry- there are room-darkening curtains if you prefer to sleep in!)  

If you would like to bring your child(ren), please send me a message beforehand.  I am sure that a small air mattress will fit beside the queen size bed (and I will prepare it for you!), but I want to share exact dimensions with you to ensure you'll be pleased with the layout of the room. Also, if you're bringing young children, please let me know!  I will ensure the cottage is stocked with some age-appropriate toys. 

Regarding breakfast, your kitchen will be stocked with a standard brew of coffee, as well as tea bags.  Upon your arrival, you will find a basket of fruit and zucchini bread (or something similar), as well as a couple bottles of water in your fridge. We have decided to leave this welcome/breakfast basket for you so as not to disturb your sleep the next morning.  During the winter months, your kitchen is also stocked with hot cocoa mix.

We currently have a dog, cats, and a chicken.  This past winter has been hard on the animals.  Pumpkin, our pet turkey passed away, as well as our duck, and one of the chickens. This spring (2023), we will be getting baby chickens, ducks and turkeys.

**Update April 2023:  We had a very bad windstorm and a handsome little rooster blew in and has fallen deeply in love with our Chicken Little.  They have moved into Pumpkin's old house and are inseparable. We realize he's an early riser and not all of us are--- so we are now providing ear plugs for each guest in the cottage (just in case.)","Stay in the Storybook Cottage at the Holliday Castle!

The cabin is close to the town but still secluded, a 24 hour gas station and restaurants are very close by.

The driveway is steep, any guest with a trailer will need a 4 wheel drive. Any large trailer will need to park on the flat right below the driveway. A 4wd is typically preferred but many cars have made it with no trouble. During the winter months of snow/ice should be present, access to the cabin could be difficult but parking and walking up is an option that others have done. We just like to make guests aware before arrival so they use their judgement.","See Rental Agreement for further info","We typically let guests do self check in, sometimes my husband does like to meet the guests if he’s available when they arrive.

Recent guest commentary: “We thoroughly enjoyed staying in your loft. So peaceful and quiet, with all the comforts of home… It’s a little diamond!” – June 7, 2021

When you first arrive at Fiddlehead Loft, you will see private parking for four cars. Enter the almost entirely enclosed & fenced yard, walk up the graveled path, and ascend the outside staircase to the second-floor loft. You’ll find yourself on a spacious covered porch with plenty of seating, including several chairs and a café table set that’s perfect for morning coffee or a snack (Brand new hammock on the way!)

Upon entering the loft, the first thing you’ll notice is the combination of warm tones and light walls with several windows letting in ample light. The stylish and modern décor throughout features greens and muted yellows, grays and browns, creams and blacks, all accented with natural fibers and live plants. This first room is a great room that encompasses a kitchen and dining area on one side and a living room on the other. A mini-split air conditioner is controlled from the living room but heats and cools the whole space.

In the living room to the right sits a comfy leather sofa and several oversized sectional chairs. A 50-inch smart TV and a bookcase filled with games, books, and magazines are ready for your relaxation. Or, if work is on the schedule, you can make use of the workspace separating the kitchen/dining area and living room. The loft is equipped with Wi-Fi. 

To the left is a beautiful modern kitchen and dining area. The table seats four (with room for two more at the workstation). The kitchen is filled with everything you’ll need to cook and serve, including a full-sized range and fridge, microwave, and coffeemaker. Plentiful cabinet and drawer space holds plate- and glassware, serving pieces, cutlery, utensils, and other small appliances, along with pots and pans. There’s also room for you to tuck away any food you purchase for your stay.

Moving through the great room toward the back of the loft space, you find on your right a lovely bathroom featuring a glass-enclosed full bath/shower combo. Brushed gold and black accents complement the white walls and gorgeous wallpaper, and a repurposed table creates the perfect vanity and sink space. The bathroom is stocked with plenty of towels and toilet paper for your stay.

Directly across from the bathroom sits an enclosed space with a stacked washer and dryer for your laundry needs.

Last, you’ll find two bedrooms in the back of the loft. The bright, naturally lit master bedroom sits to the right. A queen bed with a new memory-foam mattress is covered in soft, rich bedding, while two bedside tables sit ready to hold your current book, glasses, or nighttime toiletries. Double sconces mean you won’t have to fight with your bedmate over late-night reading. A bench at the foot of the bed is the perfect space for putting on your shoes or setting bags, while a full-sized dresser and closet await your clothes and accessories.

The cozy second bedroom sits in the back left corner of the loft. Glass French doors allow plenty of light into the space even when the doors are closed, but a pull-down shade provides privacy and darkness at night. This room contains a sturdy bunkbed set holding two double-sized mattresses with comfy bedding. There’s plenty of space to store your belongings and sconce lighting for both beds.

Filled with beautiful accents and thoughtful touches throughout, Fiddlehead Loft is the perfect home away from home for your long- or short-term travel needs. 

Notes:
•	A well-behaved and housetrained dog is welcome with a $20 nonrefundable fee per week ($10 per week for a second dog) to be collected in a separate payment. Please let us know when you book that you will be bringing a dog, so we can arrange payment. Dogs must be crated when left alone in the loft.
•	Fiddlehead Loft, although having the impression of being it's own structure, is located on the back of a building over a set of office suites (which are entered through the front of the building on a completely different side). They are almost always empty during the day and it remains very quiet. At night, the lower lever is most assuredly vacant, so you are alone in the building. 
•	Like many towns and cities in Virginia, Glade Spring is an historic railroad town, and a set of tracks does go through nearby. But the sounds are buffered and muted indoors, and guests report no issues. However, if you are particularly sensitive to outside sounds, you may wish to look elsewhere. 
•	Fiddlehead Loft is reached by a set of outdoor stairs to the second story. Those with mobility concerns may want to consider another property.

I am respectful of your privacy and will not be onsite during your stay, but I am happy to help in any way and live only a short distance if needed. Renters have full access to me via text or phone.

**Please note the loft is accessed from a side street to the back of the property.**

Glade Spring, Virginia
Located in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Southwest Virginia, Glade Spring is a quaint and peaceful little town boasting an historic square listed on the National Register of Historic Places. With easy access to the interstate and several restaurants and gas stations, it’s a convenient stop for travelers, especially those coming to the area for its many outdoor activities.

Fiddlehead Loft is located:

• 1.4 miles from I-81 on a quiet side street off Glade Spring’s historic town square. 
• 2 miles from the rails-to-trails gem The Salt Trail, the perfect place for a peaceful walk, bike, or horse ride in nature.
• 5 minutes from charming Emory, the home of beautiful Emory & Henry College. (Fiddlehead Loft is conveniently located for game-day lodging!)
• 10 mins from historic Abingdon with numerous excellent restaurants and shops, an award-winning winery, several coffeehouses, a hip brewery, and the world-renowned Barter Theatre.
• 15 mins from playful Damascus, known as Trail Town, USA. Experience the famous Creeper Trail bike ride off White Top Mountain or hop on a beautiful Virginia section of the Appalachian Trail.
• 30 minutes from the famous State Street of Bristol, VA-TN, with a variety of restaurants, shops, breweries, the 24-hour Blackbird Bakery, and the Birthplace of Country Music Museum. Don’t forget the requisite selfie of yourself standing with one foot in Virginia and one in Tennessee!
• Central to many outdoor adventure opportunities in our Blue Ridge Mountains, such as hiking in Mount Rogers National Recreation Area (look for the famous wild ponies), biking the Creeper Trail, or boating on gorgeous South Holston Lake.

** If you are looking for a last minute place to stay for the night, please feel free to send a request. I will do all I can to try to work it out.


** If you see there is only one available night left on a given weekend and you wish to stay only that one night, please contact me.

Fiddlehead Loft is located:

• 2 miles from the rails-to-trails gem The Salt Trail, the perfect place for a peaceful walk, bike, or horse ride in nature.
• 5 minutes from charming Emory, the home of beautiful Emory & Henry College. (Fiddlehead Loft is conveniently located for game-day lodging!)
• 10 mins from historic Abingdon with numerous excellent restaurants and shops, an award-winning winery, several coffeehouses, a hip brewery, and the world-renowned Barter Theatre.

Enter the almost entirely enclosed & fenced yard, walk up the graveled path, and ascend the outside staircase to the second-floor loft. You’ll find yourself on a spacious covered porch with plenty of seating, including several chairs and a café table set that’s perfect for morning coffee or a snack (Brand new hammock on the way!)

Upon entering the loft, the first thing you’ll notice is the combination of warm tones and light walls with several windows letting in ample light. The stylish and modern décor throughout features greens and muted yellows, grays and browns, creams and blacks, all accented with natural fibers and live plants. This first room is a great room that encompasses a kitchen and dining area on one side and a living room on the other. A mini-split air conditioner is controlled from the living room but heats and cools the whole space.

In the living room to the right sits a comfy leather sofa and several oversized sectional chairs. A 50-inch smart TV and a bookcase filled with games, books, and magazines are ready for your relaxation. Or, if work is on the schedule, you can make use of the workspace separating the kitchen/dining area and living room. The loft is equipped with Wi-Fi. 

To the left is a beautiful modern kitchen and dining area. The table seats four (with room for two more at the workstation). The kitchen is filled with everything you’ll need to cook and serve, including a full-sized range and fridge, microwave, and coffeemaker. Plentiful cabinet and drawer space holds plate- and glassware, serving pieces, cutlery, utensils, and other small appliances, along with pots and pans. There’s also room for you to tuck away any food you purchase for your stay.

Moving through the great room toward the back of the loft space, you find on your right a lovely bathroom featuring a glass-enclosed full bath/shower combo. Brushed gold and black accents complement the white walls and gorgeous wallpaper, and a repurposed table creates the perfect vanity and sink space. The bathroom is stocked with plenty of towels and toilet paper for your stay.

Directly across from the bathroom sits an enclosed space with a stacked washer and dryer for your laundry needs.

Last, you’ll find two bedrooms in the back of the loft. The bright, naturally lit master bedroom sits to the right. A queen bed with a new memory-foam mattress is covered in soft, rich bedding, while two bedside tables sit ready to hold your current book, glasses, or nighttime toiletries. Double sconces mean you won’t have to fight with your bedmate over late-night reading. A bench at the foot of the bed is the perfect space for putting on your shoes or setting bags, while a full-sized dresser and closet await your clothes and accessories.

The cozy second bedroom sits in the back left corner of the loft. Glass French doors allow plenty of light into the space even when the doors are closed, but a pull-down shade provides privacy and darkness at night. This room contains a sturdy bunkbed set holding two double-sized mattresses with comfy bedding. There’s plenty of space to store your belongings and sconce lighting for both beds.

Filled with beautiful accents and thoughtful touches throughout, Fiddlehead Loft is the perfect home away from home for your long- or short-term travel needs. 

Notes:
•	A well-behaved and housetrained dog is welcome with a $20 nonrefundable fee per week ($10 per week for a second dog) to be collected in a separate payment. Please let us know when you book that you will be bringing a dog, so we can arrange payment. Dogs must be crated when left alone in the loft.
•	Fiddlehead Loft, although having the impression of being it's own structure, is located on the back of a building over a set of office suites (which are entered through the front of the building on a completely different side). They are almost always empty during the day and it remains very quiet. At night, the lower lever is most assuredly vacant, so you are alone in the building. 
•	Like many towns and cities in Virginia, Glade Spring is an historic railroad town, and a set of tracks does go through nearby. But the sounds are buffered and muted indoors, and guests report no issues. However, if you are particularly sensitive to outside sounds, you may wish to look elsewhere. 
•	Fiddlehead Loft is reached by a set of outdoor stairs to the second story. Those with mobility concerns may want to consider another property.","Fiddlehead Loft is a newly renovated, thoughtful space stocked with guests in mind at every turn. Each hammered nail, design detail, and pillow purchase was executed with great hopes to serve you well and provide a beautiful, cozy environment for you to relax and enjoy your stay in. If we don’t have what you need, let us know!

As native Appalachians, my husband and I have a deep love for this region and its people and the tradition of hospitality.  We are both artists of sorts--I'm a freelance writer/reporter and he is a rock 'n roll keyboard player and works in the local school system. And we manage a herd of dairy goats, mostly LaMancha breed. All with names and personalities. Our place is about 15-20  minutes off off I-77. We're close to the notable ""Back of the Dragon"" motorcycle routes. And very close to some beautiful backroad bicycle routes. The scenery is beautiful all seasons of the year but especially the fall. We hope you'll visit!

 As for the goats, they are ""the greatest entertainers and the greatest time wasters"" as my dad used to say. He was a vet and built the house as a home and office. So it has a sort of historic/museum feel in certain sections. 

We don't guarantee food as part of our Airbnb listing,  but I love to cook and if I'm cooking, you're welcome to join us if you don't have other plans. 

Last but not least, we  love to know a little about our guests beforehand so PLEASE make sure you fill out the ""Describe Yourself"" questions under the Airbnb profile section to speed along the booking process.

Hot water radiator heat keeps the room warm in the winter and concrete floors keep it comfortably cool in the summer. There's access to a full bath with tub and shower but you must walk up a flight of stairs. I also try to keep the house as free from allergens/fragrances as possible for guests who have sensitivities (noted in House Rules below).

The wi-fi is very poor in the bedroom but great in the parlor room just down the hall.

There's a great little biking road about 1/4 mile from my home that lots of bikers love to ride. About 5 miles away is a great mountain bike trail at the Blfd WV city park. For more serious bikers, there's the Burkes Garden trail. 
For hikers, Lincolnshire Park, about 13 miles away in Tazewell, has features so beautiful you will think you're in the The Hobbit's  ""Shire.""

The Town of Bluefield, Va. operates Graham Transit. Graham Transit runs three deviated fixed routes throughout the area each day. I am a 5 minute walk from the closest bus route stop.  Bus route schedules are listed on the Town of Bluefield, Va. official website.

Whether visiting the beautiful mountains to bike or hike the Creeper Trail, sightseeing in the historical Abingdon or Bristol area, attending a game at E&H or just passing through to another destination, our goal is to provide a warm and welcoming home for your getaway. Resting on an acre of land and right off I 81 enjoy your stay in our cozy, country cottage.

The cottage sits on the corner of our family farm. It faces the road and is backed by open farmland. There is a private driveway for parking your car. A stone path leads from the driveway up 4 steps onto a covered porch. The front door has a keyless entry for your convenience. 

* The cottage entry is also accessible from a covered porch on the opposite side of the home with only one step off the grass. The entry door is not keyless. Please let us know if we can accommodate you with access.

When you enter the cottage, you will see that the living, kitchen, and dining area are open concept with a 13 ft. ceiling. We hope you will find this space warm and inviting with an exposed wood beam and large chandelier. The furniture is all new and carefully selected for the charm and most importantly comfort. There is a 43” Smart TV with Netflix in the living area and free Wi-Fi. The full kitchen area is truly open to the rest of the space and is equipped with everything you'd need to make delicious meals.

Entering the hallway from the living area, you will find the bathroom on the left. It features classic gray and white décor. The tub/shower is surrounded by subway wall tiles and a rain shower water fixture provides a great morning shower. The bathroom cabinets house enough towels, washcloths, bathmats, hairdryer, soap, shampoo, conditioner, and lotion for your stay at the cottage.

At the end of the hallway, double doors enclose the full-size washer and dryer. The laundry area also has an ironing board and iron, detergent, and dryer sheets.

The cottage has 2 separate bedrooms. Bedroom one is bright and sunny with a queen-size bed and a new memory foam mattress.  Bedroom two, painted a restful mountain blue has 2 twin-size beds and new memory foam mattresses. Both bedrooms are equipped with sheets, blankets, extra pillows, and luggage stands. There are closets in both bedrooms with plenty of storage and hangers for your clothing. There is also a portable crib available. 

With land surrounding the cottage and big trees providing shade, kids will enjoy playing outside, so bring your favorite outside games. There is a large covered porch with 2 rocking chairs. In the future, we plan to screen in the porch and add an outside entertainment area. 

Right off an interstate 81 exit, and 0.3 miles down the road our cottage is a very convenient location for just a one-night stay or an entire week or more. Please keep in mind that you will hear traffic noise from the interstate while outside. Extra construction measures were taken to provide a house that is quiet inside both day and night.

If you have special requests for your stay, just ask and we will try to accommodate.

Don’t miss it while you are here. Or come back if you do!

It faces the road and is backed by open farmland. There is a private driveway for parking your car. A stone path leads from the driveway up 4 steps onto a covered porch. The front door has a keyless entry for your convenience. 

* The cottage entry is also accessible from a covered porch on the opposite side of the home with only one step off the grass. The entry door is not keyless. Please let us know if we can accommodate you with access.

When you enter the cottage, you will see that the living, kitchen, and dining area are open concept with a 13 ft. ceiling. We hope you will find this space warm and inviting with an exposed wood beam and large chandelier. The furniture is all new and carefully selected for the charm and most importantly comfort. There is a 43” Smart TV with Netflix in the living area and free Wi-Fi. The full kitchen area is truly open to the rest of the space and is equipped with everything you'd need to make delicious meals.

Entering the hallway from the living area, you will find the bathroom on the left. It features classic gray and white décor. The tub/shower is surrounded by subway wall tiles and a rain shower water fixture provides a great morning shower. The bathroom cabinets house enough towels, washcloths, bathmats, hairdryer, soap, shampoo, conditioner, and lotion for your stay at the cottage.

At the end of the hallway, double doors enclose the full-size washer and dryer. The laundry area also has an ironing board and iron, detergent, and dryer sheets.

The cottage has 2 separate bedrooms. Bedroom one is bright and sunny with a queen-size bed and a new memory foam mattress.  Bedroom two, painted a restful mountain blue has 2 twin-size beds and new memory foam mattresses. Both bedrooms are equipped with sheets, blankets, extra pillows, and luggage stands. There are closets in both bedrooms with plenty of storage and hangers for your clothing. There is also a portable crib available. 

With land surrounding the cottage and big trees providing shade, kids will enjoy playing outside, so bring your favorite outside games. There is a large covered porch with 2 rocking chairs. In the future, we plan to screen in the porch and add an outside entertainment area. 

Right off an interstate 81 exit, and 0.3 miles down the road our cottage is a very convenient location for just a one-night stay or an entire week or more. Please keep in mind that you will hear traffic noise from the interstate while outside. Extra construction measures were taken to provide a house that is quiet inside both day and night.

If you have special requests for your stay, just ask and we will try to accommodate.","Right around the corner or right on the way, the Cottage Around the Corner is convenient for travelers. Whether visiting the beautiful mountains to bike or hike the Creeper Trail, sightseeing in the historical Abingdon or Bristol area, attending a game at E&H or just passing through to another destination, our goal is to provide a warm and welcoming home for your getaway. Resting on an acre of land and right off I 81 enjoy your stay in our cozy, country cottage.",,"41","45","61","77","79","611","657","665","pdp_m2_5_bathroom","","Bathroom","33","34","40","44","46","85","86","667","671",,"pdp_m2_5_bedroom_laundry","","Bedroom and laundry","1",,,,,"pdp_m2_5_entertainment","","Entertainment","60","64","71","72","74","392","pdp_m2_5_family","","Family","5","30",,,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_heating_cooling","","Heating and cooling","35","37","39",,,,,,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_home_safety","","Home safety","4","47",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_internet_office","","Internet and office","8","89","90","91","92","93","94","95","96","137","236","251","308","476","625","626","672","pdp_m2_5_kitchen_dining","","Kitchen and dining","57",,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_location","","Location features","99","100","101","179","219","280",,"pdp_m2_5_outdoor","","Outdoor","9","98",,,,"pdp_m2_5_parking_facilities","","Parking and facilities","53","104",,,"pdp_m2_5_services","","Services","36",,,,"pdp_unavailable","","Not included","false","5","VA","0","https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/50932268"

This gem is at the epicenter of shops, restaurants and nightlife!  Park upon arrival and enjoy all our quaint town offers within walking distance- The Barter Theatre, The Virginia Creeper Trail, The Tavern, Jack's 128 Pecan, Foresta, Summers Rooftop/Cellar, Rain, The Girl and The Raven, Wolf Hills Brewery, and much, much more- and it was literally built over a spring!

We are super Covid cleaning conscious. Additionally,  several of the restaurants within a couple blocks walk have outdoor dining/seating and the Creeper trailhead is 3 blocks away.  There is a mudroom with a bike rack for 5 bikes, and even a full sized mtn bike on-site for your convenience. You can seriously mitigate any Covid risks if you should choose to by enjoying great food, good drink, and exercise outdoors and steps away from the cottage.  Across the street from The Old Springhouse is a public park with lots of fun things for the kids and adults alike- including a covered picnic area and barbeque grill. The cottage also sits on Towne Creek with its famous resident Mallards!  Be careful though, as the creek runs thru town and is prone to have glass or debris in it. Wear shoes if wading!  There is a private driveway at the cottage but if you have more than one car, feel free to park across the street at the park.  Legend has it the park was home to the main town spring from which everyone got their drinking water.

Entire home and property including creek- enjoy but wear shoes if wading in creek to be safe.

You will have coded access to the house but we live just two blocks away so let us know if you need anything!

Literally you are within steps of the finest restaurants and theater that our area has to offer.  The renowned Highlands Festival takes place just at the top of the hill as well as Plum Alley Days and as mentioned, The Creeper trail-head and bike shops are a few blocks away. We are super Covid cleaning conscious. Additionally,  several of the restaurants within a couple blocks walk have outdoor dining/seating and the Creeper trailhead is 3 blocks away. You can seriously mitigate any Covid risks if you should choose to by enjoying great food, good drink, and exercize outdoors and steps away from the cottage. Hope to see you soon. Enjoy and stay safe!

Unless you are heading to the River, the Lake, or the AT, you can literally park your car and not move it until checkout- the best location around!

There is a firehouse across the street but the responders are VERY sympathetic to local residents and don't turn on their sirens until they are past the house and get on main street.  Also, Abingdon has a train track running the length of town- any house in town is “close”.  Several trains run during the course of the day, FYI.","Please be respectful and clean- do dishes if you use them, leave muddy shoes at back door... you know, treat it as if it were your own. ;)","You will have coded access to the house but we live just two blocks away so let us know if you need anything!","en","English","The Olde Springhouse - Downtown, Abingdon","Literally you are within steps of the finest restaurants and theater that our area has to offer.

Sit under the stars by night and under the magnificent canopy of shade trees by day.                          

Clinch Mountain is home to beautiful plant life and undergrowth, while a variety of deciduous trees form a towering canopy above.

It is truly a birdwatcher and botanist paradise.

Location is right on the trail leading to the Channel’s and is the last privately owned parcel upon entering channels state forest and natural preserve.

The great Channels are a series of deep sandstone crevices worn into sandstone outcrops on the mountains summit and form one of Virginia’s most fascinating ecosystems. It is possible to easily walk within the maze-like channels , which harbor an almost cave-like microclimate .Coupled with outstanding views from the top of these outcrops and a fire tower on Middle Knob’s summit ,this hike forms one of southwest Virginia’s most scenic and popular hiking destinations.

The hike is a hidden gem in southwest Virginia and you will find nothing else in Virginia quite like it . For the more adventurous hiker, the hike can continue on to Hidden Valley Lake ( 14 mile hike).

The road that leads to the cabin is off of the route 80 trailhead at the Russell / Washington county line. The gravel road leading to the cabin is shared with the hiking trail leading to the channels.

Step right outside of the front door at The Channels Retreat and you will be greeted by the trail's most heavily used 3 miles that travel to the Great Channels of Virginia. 

The Channels are a series of deep sandstone crevices worn into sandstone outcrops on the mountain's summit and form one of Virginia's most fascinating ecosystems. 

It is possible to easily walk within the maze-like channels, which harbor an almost cave-like microclimate and often hold snow cover long after temperatures have risen above freezing. Coupled with outstanding views from the top of these outcrops and a fire tower on Middle Knob's summit, this hike forms one of southwest Virginia's most scenic and popular hiking destinations.

It sits on the south side of Iron Mountain in the Jefferson National Forest’s Mount Rogers National Recreation Area and takes in the scenic views of Whitetop Mountain and Mount Rogers. Its proximity to sites and towns of middle Appalachia, along with its fresh water, fresh air and relaxed pace make our cabin a lovely spot to visit.

Dongola Cabin is ten miles south of Interstate-81 and the town of Chilhowie, Virginia. Atlanta, Charlotte, Roanoke, Richmond, Knoxville, and Washington DC are each between two and six hours drive. Our accommodation includes high speed internet, full kitchen and laundry facilities.  Please note, the nightly rate includes a 5% occupancy tax for Smyth County.  

**We aim to make the cabin as safe as possible for your visiting pleasure.  We disinfect the cabin after each guest and we do not allow back-to-back bookings in order to decrease the possibility of community transmission.**

Guests will have access to the entire cabin (excepting a crawl space) and land around the cabin. It also has landline for domestic calls and emergencies.

We are available by telephone/email/text message for any guests queries or emergencies.

Nearby, several trail heads intersect, including the well-known Appalachian and Virginia Creeper Trails (others include the Iron Mountain Trail, the Skulls Gap Trail, the Buzzard Rock Trail, the Bear Tree Gap Trail, the Straight Mountain Trail, the Straight Branch Trail, and the Pine Mountain Trail). Hundreds of wild blueberry bushes yield end-of-summer fruit on Whitetop and Pine Mountains. Steep mountain valleys and hollows display the colors of Spring and Autumn foliage. The Whitetop Laurel Creek, a notable wild trout stream, stretches for twelve miles down the valley floor and provides year-round fishing as well as five miles of fully accessible recreation facilities with wildlife viewing platforms in the Creek Junction area.

Scenic and historic routes surround Dongola Cabin, including the famous Route 58 ('The Crooked Road'), Grayson Highlands State Park and Parkway, the balds at Elk Garden, and the highest elevated road in Virginia towards the peak of Whitetop Mountain. From Dongola Cabin, outdoor enthusiasts can rent bicycles and lazily (or not) ride 15 miles down the Virginia Creeper Trail to the town of Damascus, take a daylong horseback ride into Pine Mountain and Mount Rogers, or just take in the vista from Dongola Cabin's spacious front porch and vintage gliding swing.

The nearest grocery store is about 30 minutes away in Chilhowie. The cabin will have basic pantry items and a few provisions for emergencies, but guests should be sure to shop for groceries before their arrival. Also, check out: the Konnarock Store and the Whitetop Store which are nearby; the Barter Theatre, and Bella's Pizza in Abingdon; the Damascus Brewery in Damascus.","We appreciate that the cabin is left in the condition it was found aside from general cleaning, and laundry.","We are available by telephone/email/text message for any guests queries or emergencies.","en","English","Great mountain view!

Quite neighborhood with two miles of walking trails, through the woods, on our property.
In St. Paul, Va. just about 7 miles away is the Sugar Hills ATV and hiking trails, and the newly remodeled ""Western Front"" with a nice Restaurant. Sugar Hill Brewery is also a great place to eat and experience local beer. 
The Hidden Valley Lake Area offers hiking, boating and fishing, and is just a few miles away. Fifteen- twenty miles away is The Channels, a majestic sandstone formation that is over 400-million years old. Great Hike !  The ""Devils Bath Tub"" is not to far away and a must see. The Pinnacle Natural Area Reserve is also very close and quite spectacular. The town of Abingdon (18 miles away) is a great little town with some excellent restaurants,  Wolf Hills Brewing Company, The Creeper Trail, The Barter Theater (state theater of Virginia!), biking and walking trails, festivals, and much more.

Please check location of the property before booking.

Take in small town vibe at First Friday in Marion.  Enjoy hot tub, ping pong, billiards, croquet, or lolling by the river.  Welcome!  Come enjoy!

The River House is a gorgeous, quiet getaway perched sublimely on the banks of the South Fork of the mighty Holston River in the Adwolfe area of pastoral Smyth County, Virginia.  Nestled peacefully on five hundred feet of this state-hatchery supported trout stream, you’ll find your cares slipping into oblivion regardless of which riverside Adirondack chair or seat in the hot tub you pick.  Here time disappears as your rhythm changes with days dissolving into dusk, sunsets become sunrises and back again.  The sound of the river will resonate in your soul.  Perfectly placed on a private triangle of land, it commands hundreds of feet on the river.  And if you need anything you’re equidistant to Marion or Chilhowie, and even closer to Jefferson National Forest, Mount Rogers, and Grayson Highlands State Park.  

Once you’re acclimated to the serene sounds and sights of this constantly coursing stream, you’ll grow to love the subtle and supple quality of The River House.  Pulling into the driveway you’ll come first to the covered porch with several seating spaces for those times when the rain washes the valley.  Off to the right, along the riverbank is a raised deck, jutting out over the stream.  Further down the bank, are a row of inviting Adirondack chairs.  As I am in this narrative, you’ll find yourself irresistibly drawn to the outside because of its unique, natural power and beauty.  But come inside for a minute.  Let’s cross the threshold.  Here’s a modest but updated kitchen, replete with a coffee bar beside the front door to accommodate company in the kitchen. From the kitchen window you’ll see a wonderful view of the river wending its way north.  Looking left, you’ll see a generous, sunny family room with a café table and six chairs, an exquisite, tufted, Cordovan leather sofa, matching chair, and daybed with trundle for an extra two sleeping berths.  Sink your bare feet into the burgundy wool and silk Persian carpet.  Walk through this sunny space and you’ll enter the hallway to the sleeping quarters.  On the right is the master bedroom appointed with a stout, king-sized furniture suite, another exquisite Persian carpet and carved floral love seat.  Across the hall is the guest bedroom with another compelling queen set.  Our choice of bedding is the Frontgate Resort line.  Linens are from Macy’s Hotel Collection.  Bedding is dried “en plein air,” so you’ll slumber in fragrant mountain sunshine.   We don’t want to anesthetize you, but you’ll love your slumber as much as your waking hours!  

Let’s step down to the lower level and see what’s going on there.  Taking the staircase from the kitchen, we alight on the lower level.  We think you’ll be delighted with the 8’ Brunswick billiards table appointed nicely with a green and buff Tiffany-style billiards light overhead.  Adjacent is an intimate two-chair café table, and wide-screen opposite.  Especially in inclement weather this is another nice and separate gathering space.  We make it easy for folks to converge and diverge. 

Back through the kitchen we come to the large gathering room with full bath.  Quietly dominating this space is a scarlet Bokhara Persian carpet – truly art underfoot.  The generous leather furnishings, glow of the fireplace and overall ambiance may invite you to linger longer than you intended.  In cold weather you’ll love the fireplace radiating warmth and light.  With the spa towels and robes in the nearby armoire, it’s tempting to take a turn in the hot tub.  

Open the patio doors and step out onto the open deck.  Out here you’re going to find your senses beset by a panoply of natural amenities competing for your attention.  You’ll see and hear the unique sounds of the river, the trees waving across green meadows in the wafting wind.  Depending upon how your day has gone, you may just decide to plop down here on the patio to relax and decide what to do next.  That may constitute nothing more than enjoying the experience of the The River House. This open deck is a natural gathering place for sitting, talking, eating and engaging with friends and family surrounded by nature’s bounty and beauty.

Or, grab your towels and robes and head for the spa.  Follow the sidewalk to the Jacuzzi six-person spa with lighting, aqua massage jets for a moment of pure relaxation on the banks of the Holston River letting the water work its wonder.  Others may prefer relaxing on the river-bank in one of the Adirondack chairs.  Recline in these comfy seats and contemplate nothing more than the moving waters.  Or light a campfire in the copper pit or carry a basket of goodies down to the picnic table.  For group lawn games, you can choose between ping-pong, croquet or bocce ball.  You can also access the adjacent storage building with ping pong table and comfortable sofas. 
Here you’ll find three easy-mount bicycles for pure holiday fun.  And if you’d rather hike, we’re happy to provide a trail map to some of the prettier vantage points on our adjacent 240 acres.  You can easily hike 1-5 miles and picnic out in the open with some of Smyth County’s most spectacular views.  Check out our trail maps.  Did we mention trout fishing!  And you can also content yourselves streaming video inside or roaming around outside with our wi-fi music speaker.  Just come have fun!

As you can see, The River House is an experience waiting to unfold beautifully and uniquely for all of our guests.  Hungry Mother State Park, Virginia Highlands Festival, Mount Rogers Naturalist Rally, Virginia Creeper Trail, Virginia Highlands Horse Trail, Appalachian Trail - endless opportunities for adventure are just minutes away.  Experience an outdoor adventure or quiet serenity.  Embrace togetherness or seek your own solitude.  However, you choose to personalize your own River House revels, we hope you leave with memories for a lifetime and long to return to do it all over again!  When you return to reacquaint yourselves with its magic, we’ll have everything ready and waiting for you.

Consider renting the river house for a romantic weekend, or a girlfriends only getaway, or a fly fishermen's holiday, or make up your own reason to spend time at the river house.  Maybe the river is calling you!

Adwolfe is a picturesque pastoral valley in the lea of Flat Ridge section of Iron Mountain adjacent historic Mount Rogers.

Personal cell number will be shared with confirmed guests upon request.","en","English","Holston River House - a Sojourn in Serenity...","Adwolfe is a picturesque pastoral valley in the lea of Flat Ridge section of Iron Mountain adjacent historic Mount Rogers.  The valley is dominated by the South Fork of the mighty Holston River, a state hatchery supported trout fishing destination.  The peace and quite may be overwhelming to city dwellers.  The sounds of rippling water over age-old rounded stones, the brilliance of starlight above an open meadow,  the smell of newly mowed hay, the tickle of dew-wet grass between your toes,  the taste of  grilled trout paired with your favorite Sauvignon Blanc...

Where ever your senses carry you, we hope your river house experience will culminate in life-long memories of fun and affection shared with family and friends.",,"The River House is a gorgeous, quiet getaway perched sublimely on the banks of the South Fork of the mighty Holston River in the Adwolfe area of pastoral Smyth County, Virginia.  Nestled peacefully on five hundred feet of this state-hatchery supported trout stream, you’ll find your cares slipping into oblivion regardless of which riverside Adirondack chair or seat in the hot tub you pick.  Here time disappears as your rhythm changes with days dissolving into dusk, sunsets become sunrises and back again.  The sound of the river will resonate in your soul.  Perfectly placed on a private triangle of land, it commands hundreds of feet on the river.  And if you need anything you’re equidistant to Marion or Chilhowie, and even closer to Jefferson National Forest, Mount Rogers, and Grayson Highlands State Park.  

Once you’re acclimated to the serene sounds and sights of this constantly coursing stream, you’ll grow to love the subtle and supple quality of The River House.  Pulling into the driveway you’ll come first to the covered porch with several seating spaces for those times when the rain washes the valley.  Off to the right, along the riverbank is a raised deck, jutting out over the stream.  Further down the bank, are a row of inviting Adirondack chairs.  As I am in this narrative, you’ll find yourself irresistibly drawn to the outside because of its unique, natural power and beauty.  But come inside for a minute.  Let’s cross the threshold.  Here’s a modest but updated kitchen, replete with a coffee bar beside the front door to accommodate company in the kitchen. From the kitchen window you’ll see a wonderful view of the river wending its way north.  Looking left, you’ll see a generous, sunny family room with a café table and six chairs, an exquisite, tufted, Cordovan leather sofa, matching chair, and daybed with trundle for an extra two sleeping berths.  Sink your bare feet into the burgundy wool and silk Persian carpet.  Walk through this sunny space and you’ll enter the hallway to the sleeping quarters.  On the right is the master bedroom appointed with a stout, king-sized furniture suite, another exquisite Persian carpet and carved floral love seat.  Across the hall is the guest bedroom with another compelling queen set.  Our choice of bedding is the Frontgate Resort line.  Linens are from Macy’s Hotel Collection.  Bedding is dried “en plein air,” so you’ll slumber in fragrant mountain sunshine.   We don’t want to anesthetize you, but you’ll love your slumber as much as your waking hours!  

Let’s step down to the lower level and see what’s going on there.  Taking the staircase from the kitchen, we alight on the lower level.  We think you’ll be delighted with the 8’ Brunswick billiards table appointed nicely with a green and buff Tiffany-style billiards light overhead.  Adjacent is an intimate two-chair café table, and wide-screen opposite.  Especially in inclement weather this is another nice and separate gathering space.  We make it easy for folks to converge and diverge. 

Back through the kitchen we come to the large gathering room with full bath.  Quietly dominating this space is a scarlet Bokhara Persian carpet – truly art underfoot.  The generous leather furnishings, glow of the fireplace and overall ambiance may invite you to linger longer than you intended.  In cold weather you’ll love the fireplace radiating warmth and light.  With the spa towels and robes in the nearby armoire, it’s tempting to take a turn in the hot tub.  

Open the patio doors and step out onto the open deck.  Out here you’re going to find your senses beset by a panoply of natural amenities competing for your attention.  You’ll see and hear the unique sounds of the river, the trees waving across green meadows in the wafting wind.  Depending upon how your day has gone, you may just decide to plop down here on the patio to relax and decide what to do next.  That may constitute nothing more than enjoying the experience of the The River House. This open deck is a natural gathering place for sitting, talking, eating and engaging with friends and family surrounded by nature’s bounty and beauty.

Or, grab your towels and robes and head for the spa.  Follow the sidewalk to the Jacuzzi six-person spa with lighting, aqua massage jets for a moment of pure relaxation on the banks of the Holston River letting the water work its wonder.  Others may prefer relaxing on the river-bank in one of the Adirondack chairs.  Recline in these comfy seats and contemplate nothing more than the moving waters.  Or light a campfire in the copper pit or carry a basket of goodies down to the picnic table.  For group lawn games, you can choose between ping-pong, croquet or bocce ball.  You can also access the adjacent storage building with ping pong table and comfortable sofas. 
Here you’ll find three easy-mount bicycles for pure holiday fun.  And if you’d rather hike, we’re happy to provide a trail map to some of the prettier vantage points on our adjacent 240 acres.  You can easily hike 1-5 miles and picnic out in the open with some of Smyth County’s most spectacular views.  Check out our trail maps.  Did we mention trout fishing!  And you can also content yourselves streaming video inside or roaming around outside with our wi-fi music speaker.  Just come have fun!

As you can see, The River House is an experience waiting to unfold beautifully and uniquely for all of our guests.  Hungry Mother State Park, Virginia Highlands Festival, Mount Rogers Naturalist Rally, Virginia Creeper Trail, Virginia Highlands Horse Trail, Appalachian Trail - endless opportunities for adventure are just minutes away.  Experience an outdoor adventure or quiet serenity.  Embrace togetherness or seek your own solitude.  However, you choose to personalize your own River House revels, we hope you leave with memories for a lifetime and long to return to do it all over again!  When you return to reacquaint yourselves with its magic, we’ll have everything ready and waiting for you.

Consider renting the river house for a romantic weekend, or a girlfriends only getaway, or a fly fishermen's holiday, or make up your own reason to spend time at the river house.  Maybe the river is calling you!","Natural splendor awaits you at The River House!  Perched on South Fork Holston River, a trout fly fishing mecca, it resonates tranquility.  The home is appointed by the finest in interior furniture and bedding.  Hike, bike, fly fish, tour nearby Mt Rogers, Grayson Highlands, Jefferson National Forest, VA Creeper Trail, or dine in historic Abingdon.

This beautiful historic mansion was constructed in 1859 by John Warfield Johnston, a Virginia Senator, and Judge of Tazewell County. The home is situated on a 3.16-acre lot and is conveniently located within walking distance of the Tazewell Main Street area. The Johnston family was very well known in Virginia for their achievements and built the home to display these accomplishments. 

John, his wife Nicketti and son George lived in the home until it was purchased by John C. Hopkins and wife Elizabeth during the Civil War. Following the war, Colonel Andrew Jackson May (“Jack”) purchased the home. Jack May was thought of as one of Tazewell County’s best known military heroes who played a significant role in the Civil War and helped retain control of the Virginia-Tennessee Railroad. May lived in the mansion with first wife Matilda May, who sadly passed away. Jack remarried Nelle Bly and had a son Colonel May. Nelle remained in the home and turned it into a school for a couple of years before it was sold to the longest owners on record, A.Z. Litz and wife Etta V. Stauber. 

While the mansion has changed ownership over the years, John Warfield Johnston’s home of grandeur remains the same over 160 years later! 

The Litz Mansion Room #1 - The Litz Suite

The Litz Suite pays homage to A.Z. Litz, in which the mansion as we know it today is named. The cozy bedroom features a queen-sized bed, fireplace, and most importantly a private on suite. The on suite is the main attraction here. Newly renovated with beautiful white tile, large glass shower, sunflower shower head and travertine corner seat, make this room a guest favorite. Located downstairs with easy access to the kitchen, dining room, living room and game room. Perfect for couples or guests that enjoy a little more privacy.","HOUSE RULES & OCCUPANCY:

Looking for WIFI & TV this rental is NOT for you. Looking for healing, inspiration, or reconnection this IS your place. Watch the falls from the comfort of your bed as you wake in the morning or from the soaking tub in the evening. Everyday the flow is different and can change within minutes of rainfall. Come experience the magic and stay in a place one guest swears was built  ""by garden gnomes and woodland fairies.""

Craftsman build.  Custom interior.  Expect the unexpected. Master has a king bed that has an open view of the waterfall. The room also has a half bath in it.  There are no doors separating master bedroom from the rest of the house.  In the hallway you will find a pot belly stove in working order. I ask guest bring their own wood as of now as I have no way of storing large amounts. There is a shower/ bath room that has its own view of the falls. In the summer months open the screened windows and soak in the tub while listening to the falls.  

The kitchen has everything a modern kitchen would need excluding a gas stove as a propane truck can not manage the drive.  Microwave, coffee pot, toaster, blender, french press, pots and pans. Then there is sugar, coffee, tea, oil and spices for your cooking needs. There is a grill that works off of gas canisters which I do stock.  You will find games, puzzles, journals to read and also write in, and 2 very large and very comfortable sitting chairs to snuggle in.  

Deck is equipped with gas fire pit, and a sofa that pulls out to make a rather large lounging space.  In the basement you will find a full sized refrigerator and washer dryer.  Then down the stairs by the creek are chairs and a fire pit for outdoor wood burning.

A 4x4 or all wheel drive are highly recommended as the driveway is steep and has tight twist and turns. Parking for single car at the bottom of the hill and there is a stone walkway to the side entry.  Guest access the house on the main floor and a code for the door will be given before guest arrive.

I am always reachable for questions but I will not be near the property.

Beautiful rolling hills with pasture and cows surround you as you drive up.

You will want to have a car to get around. The house sits at the bottom of the drive and can be quite difficult in bad weather conditions such as ice and snow.  A 4 x 4 vehicle is recommended or if not all wheel drive. Visitors are welcome to explore the property on foot also.

This amazing no pet fee dog friendly piece of heaven is 14 secluded acres on the eastern edge of our farm, founded in 1760. Beautiful meadows, forest, springs, creek and pond.  Pet friendly.  We love doggy visitors!  Hike all over  the farm, nearly 200 acres,  and surrounding area.     Enjoy the fire pit. 

Have a really large group?   Add Sunrise Cottage and Meadows, also on the farm.   Or Middleside Farmhouse, likewise on the farm.

This property has a  special meaning to us.  After being in the family about 140 years it was given as a wedding presents by my wife’s great grandfather Chrisman Stone to his daughter Carrie and her husband Glen Ward, and they built Morningside in 1900.    At their death the house and property fell out of the family for about 60 years but now 120 years after its construction it’s back,  after a year’s restoration. 

Mornngside is welcoming new friends and visitors to its tall ceilinged rooms, dark starry nights, and verdant fields.

Enjoy the comforts and quirks of a county farmhouse!

If you are in need of more space, for a bigger group, ck our Sunrise Cottage and Meadows, also on our farm, available to rent independently from Morningside.   Likewise, Middleside Farmhouse and Meadows, also on the farm. 

This is a century-old farmhouse surrounded by hundreds  of acres of open countryside.   We love visitors.  But not every single one of them is welcome!   Try as we might, we cannot keep out every errant wasp, bee, mouse, or stinkbug seeking food and shelter.  Thx for understanding!

Please bring your own bar soap and shampoo. 

What’s more, if you come in the very cold weather months, don’t expect a toasty 75 degrees throughout the house.    This is a 1900 vintage farmhouse without central heat.     Strong monitor heaters keep the central house warm, and radiant heaters scattered about do likewise, but if you’re used to Florida winters, this house will probably disappoint you on a bitter cold November or December day — what is perfectly fine for us may cold be for you.

Green Meadow Pond is fully fenced and available for your use, a great place for a dog swim, and exploring the fields and forest, but there is no fishing.

Guests are welcome to roam the acreage around the house, as well the surrounding fields and woods of the farm.    In July 2021 we added 22 acres of meadow, forest, and Green Meadow Pond, just a five minute drive from the farmhouse, which is open to your use.  It’s so pretty!!   Good dog swimming!

The farm has great dog walking, and some of the pastures are fully fenced, if your pooch normally needs a leash but you want to let him run;  just ask and I’ll tell you the details.

We are available by phone/ text if you need assistance.   Our house is just up and over the fields; you’ll see colorful flags on the fence row beside the house, and a sign for Stonefarm at the driveway.

There are many things to do around the area:
Comers Rock(Old fire tower look out)  and Hale Lake (with hiking trail)
Hiking at Grayson Highlands State Park

It’s easy to wonderfully lost on country back roads if you head out for a wandering spin — the scenery down Comers Rock Road alone is gorgeous — but most lanes will bring you back where you started eventually.

The house is fully air conditioned, tho you can also shut off the AC and open windows and let in the fresh breezes, with the help if you like of window box fans at night, when the temperature always drops beautifully.   The  mountains here stay a full ten to 15 degrees cooler than DC, Charlotte, Winston, and Charlottesville. 

It can be gloriously chilly some Summer mornings.

There are a variety of bed  sizes, but all are full or twin beds which may not be big enough for all guests. 

No secondary booking, meaning no booking for someone else’s use.","No smoking in the house.","We are available by phone/ text if you need assistance.

I am a “here if you need me” host. Call my cell, shoot a message in AirBnB. Otherwise enjoy your private life and I will enjoy mine. 276-698-5381

The river will tell you it’s mood. If it’s muddy best to stay out, if it’s easy to see the rocks and a beautiful day you are welcome. But it’s a wild river with no guarantees of safety at all. Please be smart: Wear water shoes, wear sun screen, don’t go in if you’re not sober and a healthy strong swimmer. 
The house behind GCC is abandoned and dangerous do not trespass please.

The Nest is the first right off Garrett Creek Road. Turn in at the concrete drive and park in front of the little red shed. Pull straight ahead to exit via the gravel drive.

If you see a couple of dogs, they are the neighbors “Hokie” and “Brownie” do not encourage their visiting in any way please. Feel free to say “Go home!” as commandingly as you are comfortable.",,"I am a “here if you need me” host. Call my cell, shoot a message in AirBnB.

Please do not wash pots and pans in dishwasher it will ruin them - they are not dishwasher friendly.  And please do not mix things with a mixer in the pots and pans - it will ruin them - only mentioned this because it had become a common occurrence and ruined several sets of pots and pans and they are not cheap. There will be charges for damaged pots and pans in the future.

Are you a railroad enthusiast? Bluefield prospered as a center for the railroad transport of coal.  Norfolk Southern still maintains an office at 800 Princeton Avenue in downtown Bluefield. The city offers many vantage points for photography, with spots where you can pull off the road and take spectacular photos as the trains rumble by. Of interest to children: The Ridgerunner train leaves on a milelong loop, from noon to 6 p.m. on weekends, from Bluefield City Park from April through September, but be careful: That train whistle is loud! For researchers and scholars, a wealth of information is tucked away in the Eastern Regional Coal Archives, which are attached to the Craft Memorial Library in Bluefield, including railroad memorabilia, maps, company records and historic photographs and documents.

Both Bluefield, West Virginia, and Bluefield, Virginia, have extensive bus service. The driveway is large enough to accommodate a trailer. 
ATV parking may be arranged off-site.

There is plenty of parking and you can enjoy the flicker of campfires from the campground across the road while having your own large, private area to yourself. There is a fire pit and outdoor seating area, plus a grill (both gas and charcoal provided) for outdoor cooking. The Campside Cottage is perfect for the couple looking to get away for a few days, or for the young family with small children.

Campside Cottage is located at the entrance to Hungry Mother State Park, directly across from Camp Burson campground. Situated on 3.5 acres, there is plenty of privacy. Also, located on the property is the downstairs of this unit (also a vacation rental) as well as two additional vacation rentals (The Berry Cabin and Dreamer’s Lodge). Our property (@ the lake) ends at the fence at the back of the 3.5 acres. Beyond this fence is our neighbors…please respect their privacy! :)

Plenty of parking on site. The neighborhood is very quiet and very safe.

Downtown Marion has many excellent restaurants (Mi Puerto, Macados, Wooden Pickle, Moondog, Sisters’ Cafe & Gifts, Sur 81 to name a few, as well as many fast-food chains) and shopping (Blue Ridge Outfitters, Marion Outdoors, Army/Navy Store, Just Believe Boutique, The Daisy Boutique, Willbeez Country Store and Deli, The Toy Box and others). 

Take in a movie, or a game of putt-putt at Park Place Drive-In. Grab an ice-cream at Park Place or some fudge at Willbeez Country Store and Deli. Enjoy a cup of coffee or some pastry at Better Coffee Co. or Starbucks. 


Marion’s own Lincoln Theatre, one of the last remaining Mayan Revival style theaters in the world, provides a variety of performing arts events. 

And just a short drive away…Barter Theatre, Wohlfahrt Haus Dinner Theatre, Grayson Highlands Park, The Virginia Creeper Trail, Bristol Raceway, Pinnacle Shopping Center, The Back of the Dragon, the Appalachian Trail.","Load and start the dishwasher.

Located in a gated community called Cove Creek which consists of many  large acre properties and very little development.  Several trails located directly on the property for atv riding and hiking.  The community is atv friendly and also boasts a beautiful creek containing brook trout and picturesque waterfall.  Winterplace , Hatfield Mccoy Trails, and Appalachian trail all only minutes away.

There are many things that make this cabin unique.  First, it's  a  1,200 sq foot 3 bedroom fully equipped cozy cabin property on 18 acres and has breathtaking mountaintop views and private access to our own trails for hiking and ATV'ing.  It's also centrally located to several well known mountain adventure places for White water rafting, Skiiing, ATV'ing, Hiking, and much more.  We moderately priced this so that families, couples, and friend groups alike can take advantage of it.  We have wood logs on the property for the fireplace that can be chopped and usually there is some already there.  While you feel like your in complete solitude at the top of the south side it's nice to know you have easy access to many amenities (grocery stores, restaurants, movie theater, etc) in the city of Bluefield, VA: located just minutes from the bottom of the northside of the mountain.

You have access to the whole cabin and the trails on the property as well as the trail that goes to my brothers property that can be hiked or used by ATV's.  You also have access to the private community waterfall.

We are in florida but have a property manager that is there for housing needs and/or emergencies.  I pride myself of communication and maximizing your experience.  Email or text me for any details anytime.

The cabin is located inside of a gated, sparsely populated community called cove creek.  Guests have access to the Creek which has trout and a beautiful waterfall.  The city of bluefield and Tazewell are mintues away and have many restaurants, grociery stores, and your basic amenities (there's a walmart...lol).  Also within driving distance are great adventure places like the Hatfield Mccoy ATV Trails, Appalachian Trail for hiking, Winter Place ski resort,  AceRaft for white water and many  parks with waterfalls like pipestem and the cascades.  The property itself is 18 acres and has several trails on it for hiking and atv'ing.

If it’s not snowing any car can be used to get up and down the mountain.  However if more then 2-4 inches snow is in the forecast we highly recommend 4 wheel drive.  Also, the driveway can be tough to get up and down if you aren’t use to driving in the mountains.  I can do it in a Prius as long as it’s not snowing but I have experience. Biggest hint is stick to the left side when going up. There is additional parking at the coldesac on top of the driveway if you want to play it safe

*It takes about 15-20 minutes to go up or down the mountain depending on your vehicle, what your towing, and comfortableness in mountain driving.  
*Hatfielld Mccoy trails are about 15-45 minutes from the bottom depending on which trailhead you access.  as of right now you can not access directly by ATV.
*WinterPlace is 39 miles from the bottom of the mountain and takes about 30 minutes.
*5 miles from Appalachian Trail and can actually view the mountain ridge it passes through from the cabin. 
*""The Back og the Dragon"" Trail for motorcycles is close but might have to trailer bikes down the mountain depending if you can ride on the gravel roads.","-you're expected to leave the cabin in clean condition and all trash in bags and dishes washed.  Cleaning lady is not responsible for cleaning up messes, bottles, and other trash left throughout the house and reviews will be given accordingly.
- Special consideration can be given for pets.  Message me individually 
- Accompany children at all times.
- You can smoke outside but please avoid throwing butt's on ground.
- be careful in dry seasons of fires outside.   Put any fire outside completely out with water.   Winds are strong at the top of mountain and can restart your fires that aren’t fully out out and blow embers into dry leaves.   
-  no hunting unless otherwise permitted by owner and properly licensed.
-  no chopping down of live trees or chopping into damaging move trees.   
- lastly, Don't be an idiot.","We are in florida but have a property manager that is there for housing needs and/or emergencies.  I pride myself of communication and maximizing your experience.

Sit on the porch and soak up those mountain views. Relax in the hot tub and count the stars. Reconnect with your spouse as you unplug from the hustle and bustle. Rest, laugh, enjoy! 

The cabin is located on a working family farm. You can purchase beef, pork, and chicken to cook while you’re here or bring a cooler and take some home.

Take a break from life. Get away. Come relax in solitude or with your spouse. Reconnect with nature. Breathe in that fresh air. Observe wildlife and get a taste of life on the farm.

The cabin completely private, but if you’d like to visit with family or friends there is another cabin located on the farm too. Check out our other listing for Valley View Cabin. You cannot see the other cabin, but it is located a couple hundred yards away.

You will have the entire cabin to yourself. You can go for a walk, enjoy the hot tub, grill out, roast marshmallows over the fire pit, or just rock on the front porch and take it easy.

We are available by phone (call or text) if you need anything.  We can offer suggestions of things to do while here (folder of information in the cabin). If we’re around we’d be happy to show you around the farm.

We are about a mile off of Hwy 16 (Back of the Dragon). About 10 miles from Hungry Mother State Park (hiking, fishing, beach swimming area...). We’re 25 minutes from Marion where there is an adorable Main Street with shops and eateries.  We are about 45 minutes from Abingdon (Barter Theatre, antique shopping, dining, winery...).

We are not near any public transportation.

We are about 25 minutes away from town. So, you may want to plan to stop at the grocery store on your way in. There are plenty of great restaurants in Marion. (We have a list of restaurants and activities to do while here.) FYI: Many of the Marion shops/restaurants are CLOSED on Mondays!

On our farm we raise and sell pastured beef, chicken, and pork. If you plan to cook while you are here let us know and you can order some homegrown meat ahead of time and we will have it waiting in your fridge. (Sausage or bacon for breakfast, steaks, hamburger, chicken breast, pork chops...) Bring a cooler so you can take some beef, chicken, and pork back home with you. You can see what's available and order directly through our website www.oldrichvalleyfarm dot com.","Hot tubs are very expensive.  We ask that you read and follow all rules of the hot tub (listed in the cabin) to make sure it doesn’t get damaged.
