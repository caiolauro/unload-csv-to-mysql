,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. No parties or events may be held at the Loft or on the property. 
2. No overnight guests other than those registered and approved when making the reservation online. If you are expecting visitors for a short period of time during your stay, please let your hosts know.
3. No pets are permitted without prior permission and with an additional pet charge of $25 per pet (maximum one large dog or two small dogs). Sorry, no cats are permitted ever. We have four (friendly) dogs so we will need to coordinate yard usage to avoid any possible problems. Please clean up after your pet! Pets may not be left unattended for more than 2 hours and must be in a kennel/travel carrier. If you need assistance finding a dog-sitter please contact your hosts ahead of time.
4. Trash cans and bags are provided in the Loft (under the sink in the kitchen and bathroom). If the cans get full during your stay, please take the trash out and put in one of the trash cans in, or by, the driveway. No need to take out the trash at the end of your stay.
5. No hair dying or coloring is permitted in the Loft.
6. We do not have child safety features; children are welcome if you accept liability and are comfortable knowing we have no child proofing along with many stairs.
7. Minors under the age of 18 must be accompanied, in person AT ALL TIMES, by an adult over 21. You must be 21 to book a reservation at the Loft.
8. The antler hooks by the door will not hold heavy loads. Please only hang light jackets and clothing on them.
9. Please clean your boots/shoes as well as you can before entering the building and use the boot tray upstairs by the door for your boots and shoes.
10. Please do not block neighbor’s driveways, including the apartment’s next door. We will do what we can to help you with parking (including our driveway and street parking in front of our house). Please let us know if you’re traveling with a trailer so we can help you plan for parking.
11. If you would like to sit outside, you are welcome to use the camp chairs at the bottom of the stairs. If it is raining or too sunny, feel free to sit under the carport by the house. If we are parked there, just send us a message during daytime hours (9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) and we’ll move our car: we want you to enjoy your stay! You can also sit in the backyard but be aware that our dogs will occasionally need to be let out. If you are using the yard and/or grill, we will check with you before letting out the dogs. When sitting outside after 9 p.m. please try to keep the noise down so as not to disturb the residents and neighbors.
12. Do not go out on the roof. While it looks like a great place to hang out, it’s not safe for people and walking on the shingles are likely to cause damage.
13. Without exception, no smoking, vaping or marijuana usage inside the Loft. Please don’t think it can be covered up, it cannot. We have to extensively clean to remove the contaminant before other guests can arrive. Neutralizing this contaminant inside requires a $100 minimum service fee. Feel free to step outside in the back yard and quietly enjoy a tobacco smoke or vape; you'll just need to police your butts.
14. Before you leave, please wash any dishes that you used. Clean dishes can be left in the drainer to dry and we’ll put them away.
15. No need to strip the bed or pile up used towels and washcloths upon departure but during your stay, please hang wet towels and washcloths on the towel racks, shower curtain rod or side of the bathtub.
16. Please lock the door at the bottom of the steps whenever you leave the premises, including your departure.

The Foggy Mountain Loft has the feel of a mountain hideaway but in town, close to where you want to play & eat. There's a private entrance to this simple guest loft above the garage behind our home. You'll find a basic kitchenette, full bathroom, Roku TV and WiFi. At over 50 years old, the Loft shows its age with multiple layers of paint and years of cosmetic repairs, but it has been recently renovated to create a safe, clean & comfortable space.

The Foggy Mountain Loft is a single L-shaped room which has a double bed, futon couch, and a full bathroom with bathtub and shower. You can use our Adirondack chairs to spend time outside or stay in and watch your streaming apps on the Roku TV. There isn't a stove or oven in the Loft but there is a microwave, coffee maker, hot water kettle, toaster, air fryer and electric skillet for simple food preparation, and a grill in the garage you can use upon request.  There are also many great restaurants in Logan just a few minutes away.

11. If you would like to sit outside, you are welcome to use the camp chairs at the bottom of the stairs. If it is raining or too sunny, feel free to sit under the carport by the house. If we are parked there, just send us a message during daytime hours (9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) and we’ll move our car: we want you to enjoy your stay! You can also sit in the backyard but be aware that our dogs will occasionally need to be let out. If you are using the yard and/or grill, we will check with you before letting out the dogs. When sitting outside after 9 p.m. please try to keep the noise down so as not to disturb the residents and neighbors.
12. Do not go out on the roof. While it looks like a great place to hang out, it’s not safe for people and walking on the shingles are likely to cause damage.
13. Without exception, no smoking, vaping or marijuana usage inside the Loft. Please don’t think it can be covered up, it cannot. We have to extensively clean to remove the contaminant before other guests can arrive. Neutralizing this contaminant inside requires a $100 minimum service fee. Feel free to step outside in the back yard and quietly enjoy a tobacco smoke or vape; you'll just need to police your butts.
14. Before you leave, please wash any dishes that you used. Clean dishes can be left in the drainer to dry and we’ll put them away.
15. No need to strip the bed or pile up used towels and washcloths upon departure but during your stay, please hang wet towels and washcloths on the towel racks, shower curtain rod or side of the bathtub.
16. Please lock the door at the bottom of the steps whenever you leave the premises, including your departure.","We're available during your stay for assistance or to answer questions but you'll have as much privacy as you're looking for.","en","English","Foggy Mountain Loft near Hatfield & McCoy Trails","There are many places to eat in Logan and a lot of things to do:

Chief Logan State Park: 5.6 miles
Chief Logan Recreation Center: 8.2 miles
Dunks Body Shop (Gym): 12.5 miles
H & M Bearwallow Trail connector: 1 mile
H & M Bearwallow Trailhead: 4.1 miles
H & M Rockhouse Trailhead: 13.8 miles

H & M Devil Anse Trailhead: 34.6 miles

Gas station (which usually has the cheapest gas in Logan) is just about a mile away (just past the coffee house and bakery...)!","This is a 2nd floor loft with a narrow staircase, so you'll need to keep an eye on small children and keep in mind your own ability to climb stairs.","The Foggy Mountain Loft is a single L-shaped room which has a double bed, futon couch, and a full bathroom with bathtub and shower. You can use our Adirondack chairs to spend time outside or stay in and watch your streaming apps on the Roku TV. There isn't a stove or oven in the Loft but there is a microwave, coffee maker, hot water kettle, toaster, air fryer and electric skillet for simple food preparation, and a grill in the garage you can use upon request.  There are also many great restaurants in Logan just a few minutes away.","Great place near Hatfield & McCoy trailheads! The Foggy Mountain Loft has the feel of a mountain hideaway but in town, close to where you want to play & eat. There's a private entrance to this simple guest loft above the garage behind our home. You'll find a basic kitchenette, full bathroom, Roku TV and WiFi. At over 50 years old, the Loft shows its age with multiple layers of paint and years of cosmetic repairs, but it has been recently renovated to create a safe, clean & comfortable space.","On street parking is easy to find near Foggy Mountain Loft. If you're raveling with a trailer you'll be able to find a spot within a couple blocks of the Loft. With prior arrangement, guests traveling with a trailer can have the parking spaces in front of  our house saved by us until their arrival or can park in the driveway (pulling truck into carport, there's room for a trailer with one ATV).","41","45","61","77","79","657","665",,"pdp_m2_5_bathroom","","Bathroom","40","73","85","86",,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_bedroom_laundry","","Bedroom and laundry","1",,,,,"pdp_m2_5_entertainment","","Entertainment","392",,,,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_family","","Family","5","30","139",,,,"pdp_m2_5_heating_cooling","","Heating and cooling","35","36","39",,,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_home_safety","","Home safety","4","47",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_internet_office","","Internet and office","8","89","90","91","93","94","137","146","236","251","308","476","626",,,,,"pdp_m2_5_kitchen_dining","","Kitchen and dining","57","663",,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_location","","Location features","99","101","280",,,,"pdp_m2_5_outdoor","","Outdoor","9","23",,,"pdp_m2_5_parking_facilities","","Parking and facilities","53","103","104",,"pdp_m2_5_services","","Services","33","34",,,"pdp_unavailable","","Not included","false","4.95","WV","0","https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/47385627"

Immersed in the lush hills of Blaine, Kentucky, discover our estate - a hidden jewel wrapped in nature's grandeur. As you traverse the scenic countryside to reach us, the captivating vistas and serenity set the tone for a remarkable retreat.

Nestled amidst unparalleled tranquility, the seclusion of our haven beckons you to disconnect and enjoy the simpler pleasures. We suggest stocking up on your favorite food and beverages before arrival, given the remote location. Small local markets lie within a 5-10 minute drive, while larger facilities in Paintsville, KY, are a 30-minute journey.

An enchanting, gated driveway of nearly a mile ushers you in, winding through the verdant hills. The ascent to the 800' elevation promises an unforgettable spectacle, climaxing with the reveal of a custom-built, all-brick mansion at the final curve. (In snowy conditions, a 4 wheel drive vehicle is advisable.)

At the summit, pause and drink in the panoramic views, where time seems to stand still. It's like camping atop a mountain, with the luxury of a sprawling 6,000 sq ft estate as your 'tent'.

Upon entering, you are greeted by a welcoming foyer. The main floor encompasses a cozy bedroom, a full bathroom, a functional laundry room, a spacious living room, a well-equipped kitchen and dining room, and direct access to the pool room. Ascend to the second floor to find three beautifully appointed bedrooms, including a luxurious master suite with an en-suite bathroom, and an additional full bathroom. Intriguingly, one of the third-floor bedrooms is uniquely accessible through a second-floor bedroom. Venture to the basement, and you'll discover two additional bedrooms, a full bathroom, and an expansive game room/living space.

Our home boasts 7 inviting bedrooms and 5 full bathrooms, each designed for utmost comfort. Following adventurous days exploring the trails, the indoor heated pool and hot tub offer a perfect sanctuary to relax and rejuvenate.

The estate’s expanse includes 200 acres of scenic trails. Acquired in 2021, we're restoring neglected paths to their former glory. Traverse along high ridges, and be mindful of your surroundings as some trails lead to dead ends. Children must always be supervised.

Experience a getaway where the beauty and potential risks of nature intertwine. Here, the incredible views from the peaks are as breathtaking as the valleys are deep. Prepare for a vacation where adventure, relaxation, and unforgettable moments await you!

ANYONE WHO PLANS TO BRING ANY TYPE OF ATV OF UTV IS REQUIRED TO SIGN A WAIVER IN ORDER TO RIDE ON THE PROPERTY. Booking of this property acknowledges that the entire group staying understands this policy and the person who books is fully responsible for making sure each individual in their party is aware of the waiver and signs the waiver before riding.

Winter bookings: Please be advised, the driveway and the roads will not be serviced in the winter. If you are arriving during or after snowfall you will need four wheel drive.

Guests are welcome to message through the app with any questions or concerns. If you plan to check in later than 8pm please make sure to review the check in instructions as we may not be available after that time.

This location is very remote. There are local markets within 5 or 10 minutes as well as a gas station. There is a market about 7 minutes away located in Martha that has good pizza, but there is no delivery. Larger retail stores and fast food chains are located 30 minutes away in Painstville.

If you plan to visit after we get snow, make sure to bring a 4 wheel drive vehicle or you will not make it up the driveway. We typically don't get a lot of snow, but when it does come, a 4 wheel drive vehicle is a must!

Local recommendations can be found in our personally created guidebook. The guidebook can be found in the itinerary for your stay.

The bidet seen in the master bathroom is not operational. Please do not turn on the water to this feature.

While the hot tub is an attractive amenity, unexpected repairs can occasionally happen. For this reason we cannot guarantee the hot tub 100% of the time.

As you traverse the scenic countryside to reach us, the captivating vistas and serenity set the tone for a remarkable retreat.

Nestled amidst unparalleled tranquility, the seclusion of our haven beckons you to disconnect and enjoy the simpler pleasures. We suggest stocking up on your favorite food and beverages before arrival, given the remote location. Small local markets lie within a 5-10 minute drive, while larger facilities in Paintsville, KY, are a 30-minute journey.

An enchanting, gated driveway of nearly a mile ushers you in, winding through the verdant hills. The ascent to the 800' elevation promises an unforgettable spectacle, climaxing with the reveal of a custom-built, all-brick mansion at the final curve. (In snowy conditions, a 4 wheel drive vehicle is advisable.)

At the summit, pause and drink in the panoramic views, where time seems to stand still. It's like camping atop a mountain, with the luxury of a sprawling 6,000 sq ft estate as your 'tent'.

Upon entering, you are greeted by a welcoming foyer. The main floor encompasses a cozy bedroom, a full bathroom, a functional laundry room, a spacious living room, a well-equipped kitchen and dining room, and direct access to the pool room. Ascend to the second floor to find three beautifully appointed bedrooms, including a luxurious master suite with an en-suite bathroom, and an additional full bathroom. Intriguingly, one of the third-floor bedrooms is uniquely accessible through a second-floor bedroom.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1.  Quiet time starts at 11 PM until 8 AM each day.

2.  Please do not move any of the furniture or home decor unless you feel like something may get damaged or stained, an example would be table cloth or runner.

5. Upon leaving the Airbnb please make sure all lighting is turned off, including outside lighting, and the air conditioning is turned up to 74 and or the heat down to 65.

6.  Upon leaving the Airbnb please make sure all the dirty dishes are in the dishwasher and the towels washcloths and hand towels placed in the washing machine with the washer door left open.

7.  The Jacuzzi tub jets always need to be pushed in a downward direction otherwise water will be squirting all over the bathroom. There is one master control on the right corner, a button that you push down. This button also turns the Jets off.
To the left of that button is a set of buttons that creates therapeutic bubbling for a spa like experience.
After the Jacuzzi tub is turned off at some period of time you will hear it kick on Making a loud noise,and this is the Jacuzzi tub clearing the jets of water it is completely normal.
Please do not put any types of bath oil,  bubble bath , bath salts etc. or anything in the Jacuzzi tub as this will cause damage. 
If by accident excessive water get on the floor or tub surround area, there are extra old towels and Linens to clean the water up underneath the dryer drawer.

8.  Please do not put any feminine hygiene products in the toilets and or baby wipes or adult wipes 
as this will clog up the plumbing system.

10.  If a service animal  is accommodating you during your stay please do not allow the animal on the furniture or bedding or the nice decorative throws that are throughout the house and or apartment. We love animals but it is extremely expensive to clean pet hair from upholstered fabrics and linens.

11.  We ask that you be conservative with the utilities such as electric and water. We do not want any of our guest to be Uncomfortable with heating, cooling, and water usage. Being conservative with the utilities keeps the cost of the Airbnb rental down.
Please leave the heating and air-conditioning unit on auto. Please do not switch this to fan. 

12.  The mattresses and pillows are new and are Nectar brand which is similar to Tempur-pedic. We let our guest know this in case they prefer a different kind of pillow. We do have a variety of pillows.

13.  The house  includes a front loader washer and dryer. Please clean the lint filter on the dryer after each use  and before you leave as this can be a fire hazard. Please leave the washer door open upon leaving or when not using as this will cut down on mildew and mold smell in the washer.

2.  Please do not move any of the furniture or home decor unless you feel like something may get damaged or stained, an example would be table cloth or runner.

3.  Please do not take any items from the home including home decor, towels, sheets,  linens , candles, throws, cleaning supplies tissue paper and or paper towels.

4. There is no smoking allowed in the Airbnb. You may smoke outside, however please do not throw the cigarette butts in the yard or landscaping.

5. Upon leaving the Airbnb please make sure all lighting is turned off, including outside lighting, and the air conditioning is turned up to 74 and or the heat down to 65.

6.  Upon leaving the Airbnb please make sure all the dirty dishes are in the dishwasher and the towels washcloths and hand towels placed in the washing machine with the washer door left open.

7.  The Jacuzzi tub jets always need to be pushed in a downward direction otherwise water will be squirting all over the bathroom. There is one master control on the right corner, a button that you push down. This button also turns the Jets off.
To the left of that button is a set of buttons that creates therapeutic bubbling for a spa like experience.
After the Jacuzzi tub is turned off at some period of time you will hear it kick on Making a loud noise,and this is the Jacuzzi tub clearing the jets of water it is completely normal.
Please do not put any types of bath oil,  bubble bath , bath salts etc. or anything in the Jacuzzi tub as this will cause damage. 
If by accident excessive water get on the floor or tub surround area, there are extra old towels and Linens to clean the water up underneath the dryer drawer.

10.  If a service animal  is accommodating you during your stay please do not allow the animal on the furniture or bedding or the nice decorative throws that are throughout the house and or apartment.

This unique airbnb looks and feels like home..  Newly renovated and on the first floor,  this guest suite has it's own private entrance, washer dryer, full bathroom, access to full kitchen, 60"" flat screen, Apple TV,and WIFI.   Just minutes from downtown Ashland and only a few miles to Hunington, WV. You will love the quiet flavor of the neighborhood.  It's a perfect location for travelers who are enjoying all the Tri-State Area has to offer.

Located off Interstate 64 off the Catlettsburg exit. The home is only 2 miles from King’s daughters hospital and Central Park, as well as downtown Ashland. 3 miles from Ohio, 5 miles from Marathon Petroleum Company, and 15 miles from Huntington, WV.

Guests have access to their own private driveway. The front driveway is all yours, no need to worry about anyone blocking you in, for I park around back in the garage. Guests have access to the entire first level, as well as the second floor kitchen.

I am very accessible and easy to get ahold of, whether by text, call, email, or through Airbnb.

The neighborhood is located in a nice and quiet part of town near a dead end street, so traffic and noise is kept at a minimum.

My house is located in the heart of Ashland.  It far from all the things Ashland offers, and not far from the interstate and highways. Besides being in Kentucky, you can get to Ohio or West Virginia with ease.

Guests will have access to their own full bathroom, access to a fully furnished kitchen, two leather coaches, washer and dryer, closet space for luggage and clothing, a table/work space, and a queen bed.","- Shoes off at the door if possible (new carpet),  smoking allowed outside (ashtray and chair provided) House.

he might enjoy listing one of his furnished apartments for short-term rental.

He and his wife Cecilia have been married for over 50 years and have three grown children. His oldest daughter Angela rents her Farm House and Barn Loft on Airbnb, his youngest daughter Cara works as a nurse at CAMC, and his son Keith has been a missionary in Uganda.

I love people and am available most anytime to answer questions, take care of requests and resolve any issues to ensure a perfect stay.

This apartment is located above a local well known consignment shop.  Housed in a historical two story brick building built in the 1920's. Make sure you check out Suplex Tacos one block down or our local restaurants like The Winchester, Fat Patty's, La Finca’s, Blazer’s, Smoking J’s BBQ or Texas Roadhouse for a great steak.

Ample complimentary off street parking is available on all sides of the building. If you are flying in from Huntington or Charleston Airport, you can use I-64 W to US-23 N then turn left on 23rd St. Bus stop is a block away but only offers a limited schedule.

This apartment is located on a second floor. There is no elevator access. Our Central Park is within 1 block as is one of our main hospitals, Kings Daughters Medical Center.
Effective 9/01/19, the City of Ashland passed an ordinance requiring hosts of all Airbnbs within the city to collect from guests a local 3% tourism tax on each reservation. This is in addition to KY state tourism tax collected. You will find this tax under the ""Community Fee"" at checkout. Pets are absolutely prohibited. Failure to follow this no pet rule will result in immediate departure.
Due to our insurance liability, no commercial use of the space is allowed. Only registered guests are allowed. Parties are prohibited. Failure to abide by these rules will result in immediate cancellation of reservation and immediate departure.","All guests are expected to respect that others reside in the same apartment building.

We love to meet each of our guests but also realize that’s not always feasible. Our interaction can be as much or as little as our guests would like. We are a busy family so we are often not around in evenings. We offer self check in for all guests but are happy to show you to the room personally if you’d like!

Riverlike Estates is a fairly large, quiet neighborhood located a few miles outside of Saint Albans, WV. It is perfect for walking, jogging, or cycling. Neighbors are very friendly! In the middle of the neighborhood is a lake where you may fish, as well as basketball court and play grounds. Secluded neighborhood gives a serene feel to the space.
Though it is a few miles from town it is still convenient to essential amenities. A Dollar General store and Par Mar Convenience store/gas station are both located within walking distance and other essentials (coffee shop, restaurants, post office, library, banks, laundry mat, grocery stores, etc) are only a couple minute (3-5 minute) drive back to town.

This space is located several miles from the nearest bus station and buses do not run to our neighborhood. Uber and Lyft (as well as local taxi service) are available if you do not have transportation of your own. Parking for your vehicle is provided in our driveway.

Please be aware that we do have children and pets. They will not be in your space, but you will definitely see ""signs of life"". Our Labradoodle Barnabas and his sidekick Goldendoodle Finn might greet you with a bark, and you'll see our children (or their toys) playing in the yard frequently. 

Check out time is no later than 10:00am. If you'd like a later check out you must let us know 48 hours prior to your arrival. A $10 fee will be assessed for later check out. Late check out will be granted based on availability.

As listed in the amenities section, we have a TV in the space but no cable. Some guests choose to bring their own streaming device (FireStick, AppleTV, etc) or just use the DVD player we have available. 

Coffee is provided in room for your convenience as well as a few snacks and cold breakfast items (breakfast bars or oatmeal)

There is a mini fridge, electric kettle and microwave in the room for your use. 
 
We do have children in our home and while we attempt to keep the noise levels to a minimum, please know that it is likely that you will hear us throughout your stay.

There are several small businesses within walking distance. I offer a private parking lot with 24-hour surveillance. An adorable dog lives next door and offers free petting and tail wags.

Guests have the entire apartment to themselves, plus access to the shared hallway, stairwell, and parking lot.

I will provide the door code and other logistics prior to arrival.  

You won't be sharing any part of the apartment, so feel free to come and go as you please.

I live in the back apartment, which is just across the hallway, so if you need anything please let me know.

The apartment is located in a quiet neighborhood, and it's close to downtown and local parks.  There are several small businesses within walking distance.

There is a bus stop located out in front of the apartment. A short walk down the road will take you to downtown Huntington.

***Cleaning Routine***
I meticulously clean all parts of the apartment. All linens are washed in hot water with Tide sensitive skin pods and fragrance free bleach.  I wipe down all surfaces with clorox spray and then wipe the surfaces a second time to make them shiny with 409 multi spray. I vaccum the floors and use Bona cleaner since the floors are antique. I also wipe down the hallway leading to the apartment. I don't use the shared hallway while I have guests to minimize any possible risks of exposure. I use our back door to come and go.

The rented space is listed as Apartment 2.  Please enter through the front door, marked with a metallic Airbnb logo. At the top of the stairs, the door will be on your right; also marked with a metallic Airbnb logo.

It is nestled in the mountains of Hurricane, WV. It has a serene view of the mountains and a fully stocked pond, ready for fishing. You will have the entire home to yourself, complete with a kitchen, living room, bathroom, and bedroom. On the deck there is a hot tub and a fire pit directly below. You will also have access to Meeks Mountain Trails, so bring your bikes and walking shoes!

Steps inside the front door, a kitchen providing an oven, stove, and fridge will greet you with basic cooking and baking needs. There is also a drip coffee pot available for your morning coffee. Moving to the living room, you will find a sofa and accent chair in front of a large windowed garage door boasting beautiful views of the scenery outside. There is also a 43 inch TV for your viewing pleasure. Moving to the full bathroom, you will find a standing shower where shampoo, conditioner, and body wash will be provided. The bathroom leads to the bedroom, which holds a full size bed and another 43 inch TV. Outdoor seating is available on the deck for four people along with a luxury spa for two to four people. Below the deck, you will find a fire pit with seating for four people as well.

There are two parking spots available.  Four wheel drive vehicles are not a must, but preferred for easy access to The Hideaway. However, transportation is provided with guests who may be hesitant to drive their vehicle to the top of the hill, where The Hideaway resides.

My wife and I live on the property where The HideAway is, so we are always available for anything you may need.

You will be completely secluded with only the mountains and pond in view.  Minutes away, the town of Hurricane awaits with its many restaurants and community activities. If you are visiting us during the summer, paddle boarding is available on the city reservoir through the Appalachian Boarding Company. Hurricane Valley Park is approximately one mile away where you can enjoy a wave pool, baseball field, soccer field, frisbee golf, and dog park. Some of our favorite local restaurants include Whiskey Taco, Baked Craft Wings, Fireside Grille, Belknap Dough Company, and Bridge Cafe and Bistro. Our go-to coffee shop is Drip on Main Street in Hurricane. While you’re there, make sure to swing by Peyton & Peppy Boutique for a new addition to your wardrobe. Lastly, if you’re looking for something sweet, Sweet Mama’s Bakery is the place to go. We are also conveniently located approximately thirty minutes from both cities of Charleston and Huntington where many more restaurants, shopping, and activities await you.

Private parking is available at The Hideaway.

A jon boat will be available to cruise around the fully stocked pond, so make sure to bring your fishing poles! Due to limited cell service, free wifi is provided.",,"My wife and I live on the property where The HideAway is, so we are always available for anything you may need.","en","English","The Hideaway on Tacketts - Shipping Container","You will be completely secluded with only the mountains and pond in view.

I'm Brad.
Huntington has always been my home and I enjoy meeting folks from other places.
I enjoy backpacking, wildlife, fishing, riding mountain bikes, and mostly hiking long distances in the mountains. 
Airbnb is a new venture for me and I love making things nice for the guests and treating them like I like to be treated.  The reviews are a cool reward.☺☺☺

Our guest house is very private, quiet, cozy, secure and exceptionally clean.   A great couples retreat with 2+miles of hiking trails and a vast space for outdoor activities and wildlife viewing. 
   The beds are comfortable and the heat and air conditioning are great.  We have all the amenities...all linens and beddings are furnished.  There is a washer, dryer, iron and hair dryer and detergent.
We are nestled on over 100 acres of land and are 1000 feet from the nearest highway.

A clean and cozy guesthouse with nice touches of hardwood and hard surfaces. 
  One bedroom has a queen bed and the other has a bunkbed and both include bedding and extra blankets.
  There is a living room with a 4k smart TV, LAN line,  wifi router, Fast internet (119 mbps), and Roku.
  A wooden deck provides a great place to sit outside and relax and entertain.
Very private, safe, and secure.  Absolutely no animals or pets  allowed.

You will have access to the guesthouse and some hiking trails on the property.

I enjoy talking to to the guest but understand the  importance of letting the guest have their space.  I can be contacted by text, phone, or in person.

Our place is only 6 minutes from Cabell Huntington  Hospital and 10 minutes to Marahall University.  We are located just 1.5 miles south of interstate 64 at exit 11 with the comforts of a rural country setting and the convenience of being close to town.  The space is cozy and private.  The property offers hiking trails and wildlife viewing for those wanting to get out in nature.

You'll be best traveling via car in the the Huntington area and a 4 wheel drive when the roads get snowy.

NO ANIMALS- NO SMOKING OR VAPING INSIDE-NO PARTIES-NO DRUGS.  
This is a new listing and it's a new venture for me and my family.    I concider it to be a exceptionally clean place with plenty of privacy and easy access to the interstate and downtown Huntington.","No pets.

Married to an incredibly beautiful and loving woman, Lisa.  Blessed with an amazing family including wonderful kids, 4 grandchildren, nieces, nephews and a bunch more. Plus add in the greatest friends anyone could ask for and life is amazing.  

We love concerts,  camping and relaxing on the porch.  Our passion is traveling preferably through abnb but also in both 5 STAR resort style or in a tent under the stars.  All have their own perks.  

We look forward to being immersed amongst many of the cultures our beautiful planet has to offer as we age gracefully together.   

We strive to provide our guests with a “RIVERTIME” experience that brings back smiles and laughter as they reminisce about their visit as they too age gracefully. 

Godspeed to all.

Located a few mins from Ashland KY, Ironton OH & 20 mins to Huntington WV. Once you make your way into the backyard you will quickly forget that you are in an Eastern KY residential area.  The stunning view of the Ohio river & the Russell/Ironton bridge provides a mind blowing visual display.  It’s often stated the view rivals the top landscapes & city skyline views from around the world. *A misting zone is added in the summer.

They say staying here at “Rivertime” is an experience.  As you walk out the back door, take a deep breath, look out at the view and then exhale letting the stress of life fade away.  This is when the whole experience thing starts to sink in.  So now it’s time to hit the covered 30’x10’ deck.  Throw up your feet in one of the comfortable patio chairs or take a nap on the sofa.   As the night comes on enjoy dinner and beverages with the beautiful bridge and water as your back drop.  Then start up the fire and create your tasty treats.   Before you head in for the night, it’s time to slip into the hot tub for a few minutes.   As the last little bit of stress that’s locked up starts to melt away take another deep breath, exhale and smile because you’re on Rivertime!

We have a heater on the deck that allows you to comfortably relax outside on the cool fall days.  On the coldest winter days add a blanket and kick back too. 

During summer visits we add a “Misting Fan” on the end of the deck.  This is so you can stretch out on one of our lounge chairs and get your tan on while the cool mist keeps you feeling cool.   It’s crazy how well the misting can works to keep the backyard feeling 10-15° cooler than it really is on the hottest summer days.

We are usually available within minutes of contact even though we own and run several businesses here in the area.  We live next door @ 111 just on the other side of a RETRACTABLE PRIVACY FENCE that allows for a more private Rivertime experience.   We have lived on the river for 8 years now and thought it was much to special of a place for us not to share it with the world.  We hope you visit soon.

Being located in downtown Russell you’ll get to experience the relaxing lifestyle of “small town America” that millions dream about being part of.   You’ll see kids riding bikes.  People walking their dogs.  People sitting on their front porches and waving to neighbors as they drive by.   We also have “Ferry St.” where you can shop, eat, drink and create MEMORIES  that’s only a few minutes walk along the riverbank.  We’re all even more excited about this area because of a RECENTLY OPENED BREWERY.  It’s owned by a family that has built this business after years of dreaming about it.  And Eridanus Brewing is already a local favorite. There’s The Nest Spa.  A luxurious full service spa that’s even got an amazing Salt Cave. Please start the booking process now because they stay full.  There’s a bakery with morning treats and a lunchtime menu.  Want to shop? There’s several unique boutiques with lots of locally made treasures. A really cool antique shop. There’s an event room at Bluegrass Mama Creations that is primarily used for paint parties you can schedule,  but you can also rent it out.  ALL OF THIS IS ONLY A 1/2 MILE AWAY.   We will send a highlighted list along other local favorites a day or so before you arrive.

Take a walk down Riverside Dr and see more of the amazing scenic views. Don’t be afraid to take your dogs too.  As long as they play well with others because there’s  always people out taking their best friends for a walk.

Parking is very limited.  There’s a driveway big enough for two small or 2 med vehicles.  We can fit two Ford flex’s in that spot.  It is only big enough for one large truck. Then the XL f250, 2500 or duelly type vehicles may have a hard time swinging in.   If this is your case we do have additional parking that we can discuss.   THERE IS NO ON-STREET PARKING FOR RIVERTIME GUESTS or ANYONE TRYING TO VISIT.  Visitors must use the driveway or you can let us know ahead of time because again, we do have some other arrangements we can discuss.  This is a small river-town where the properties are very close together. But you still feel a large sense of privacy.","🚨Parking is limited.  No more than two cars will fit in the driveway. There is no on-street parking at the property.  If you need to have additional parking there may be other options that we can discuss. These options are NOT guaranteed.  There may be fines and negative reviews for not following parking policies.                               👉 🚨🚨 PETS: Dogs are allowed. They must be kept on a leash when taking them outside.  You must be outside with them at all times. There are other dogs in the neighborhood so please KEEP your friend inside when you are inside and off the furniture.  You will be responsible for any damage done by your pet to furniture or the home itself.  There is an additional $50 charge for dogs.  It’ll be $75 for 3.  No more than 3 dogs allowed at once.  These charges are in place due to the extra cleaning we must do to ensure our nexts guests have a clean environment and anyone with pet allergies will have a great stay too. 

SORRY, NO CATS. 

🚨 Outside noise level must be respectful of others in the area. At 10pm there should be no music outside or loud conversations.  🚨 All fires must be extinguished prior to leaving the fire unattended for the night .  🚨 NO SMOKING WHILE IN THE HOT TUB! The hot tub must have an adult in there when someone under the age of 16 is using it. 🚨Please turn off all outside lights, fans and cover the hot tub before going in for the night.","We are usually available within minutes of contact even though we own and run several businesses here in the area.

This secluded property is nestled in a serene country setting on 40 acres, surrounded by hills, tall pines, and a pond-front view. Pure Country is a place to escape that gives all visitors the opportunity to flee from the fast-paced world. Just minutes from I-64, and the Huntington Tri-State Airport.

This spacious home offers a comfortable and relaxing stay for your vacation.

On the main level, you'll find three inviting bedrooms with cozy queen beds, ceiling fans, and flat screen TVs for your comfort and entertainment. Additionally, there are two full baths, ensuring convenience for all guests.

The upper deck, accessible from the kitchen area, provides the perfect spot to unwind and savor your morning coffee. Immerse yourself in the tranquil ambiance as you listen to the melodies of wildlife and the soothing sounds of nature.

Adjacent to the living area, you'll discover a fully equipped kitchen and dining area, complete with a microwave, dishwasher, and a convenient coffee and tea bar. We've also stocked the cookware you need to prepare delicious home-cooked meals. However, if cooking isn't part of your vacation plans, fret not! Numerous local restaurants are just a short drive away.

Relax and bond with your loved ones in the family room, where a cozy gas-burning fireplace awaits. Gather around and enjoy a movie together, with access to Wi-Fi and Dish Network for your entertainment needs.

The lower level of the house offers an additional spacious area with a well-equipped kitchen, perfect for prepping your meals before heading out to the gas grill just steps away.

Immerse yourself in the beauty of nature surrounding the property. Embark on a nature hike, find solace in a captivating book by the lake, or indulge in the tranquil activity of fishing. As dusk settles in, embrace the crackling fire and witness the enchanting sight of fireflies illuminating the night. Look up at the star-filled sky and let feelings of tranquility wash over you. Take a deep breath of the fresh country air and appreciate the wonders of our world.

We can't wait to host you and provide an unforgettable experience during your stay.

We are within short driving distance to: Marshall University, Cabell Huntington Hospital or St. Mary's, the Huntington Mall The place is small, quaint and cozy, offers a full kitchen, comfy bed, we live close to a highway so there is some traffic and our driveway is at a incline we are in a protected area which is near the city and on a bus line.  
Also, our Wi-Fi is FAST!! 
Stay with us; voted the most desired AirBnB in Huntington in 2018!

This cute small house is perfect for overnight or a few days. It is a full 4 room apartment/small house above the garage. It used to be an rental space and now it's returned as an AirBnB. You have your own little apartment-style space - it is NOT shared with anyone.

Additionally, the yard is completely fenced in for your pet, we have 2 dogs here already!  The space is entirely yours, and protected as part of the backyard of our property but with it's own personal area.

The road is sometimes busy as you pull in but we have not had any issues.

I live in the main house and we are happy to help.

The houses are not on top of each other and there's a large backyard. There is a 2 lane road out front, and the river on the other side of the guard rail. Great view but no river access.

This location is heavily car-dependent with a bus coming by 3 times daily.

We have dogs, as does the neighbor. If you are uncomfortable around dogs this may not be the AirBnB for you.  Please be careful to close the gate as you are coming and going. 
Additionally, our neighbor raises chickens, ducks, quail and a host of other animals but they are just in the neighboring yard so they shouldn't be of any concern.","Hi, thanks for booking!

Please read and agree to the these simple guidelines we request:

- If possible, send us an estimated time of arrival so we can plan for it. We just want to be available in case you need anything.

- If you are going to bring pets (we LOVE furbabies) -please, no more than 2 animals. Also, if your animal has aggression issues or another behavioural issue, advise us in advance so we can keep our own pups safe!

There's a Tudor's Biscuit World Restaurant on site.  Other restaurants nearby.  Also Chief Logan state park is just a couple of miles down the road.  There is a Carwash close by

Bearwallow is a fun trail. Small but worth a good ride. There is a hill climb on 35, a
Coal mine on 36, a Collapsed coal mine on 86.  83 is a fun,  but more technical trail that has a deep mud pit on it. 
27 has two decent mud holes right in the middle of a wide open area. 
28 is nothing but mud.

Nice fire pit with benches.  Please bring your own firewood.  Also have a corn  hole game on-site.

If you are going to use your GPS remember you are in West by God Virginia and the ""Country Roads"" are just that!  So, follow your path carefully and go to your destinations...Usually people decide they are ""lost"" when in fact they are going in the right direction...So if you use GPS trust the directions and don't second guess the computer lol!  Or, ask us for directions and follow them to the letter and you will do just fine ;)  Thanks, Joe Boffo

The space is an open floor plan and has many cool design features.  This Yurt has a queen bed and three pull-out queen sofas and a 65"" TV with free WIFI and equipped with an Amazon Fire Stick for your viewing pleasure.  The Mountaineer Yurt also has an L-shaped bar that doubles as a dining area/gathering space. And, don't forget to check out the jacuzzi on the back deck ;) Oh and one more thing; the Mountaineer has a full bathroom/shower and get this...It's an ""outhouse"" built inside the house!
