Sit on the porch and soak up those mountain views. Relax in the hot tub and count the stars. Reconnect with your spouse as you unplug from the hustle and bustle. Rest, laugh, enjoy! 

The cabin is located on a working family farm. You can purchase beef, pork, and chicken to cook while you’re here or bring a cooler and take some home.

Take a break from life. Get away. Come relax in solitude or with your spouse. Reconnect with nature. Breathe in that fresh air. Observe wildlife and get a taste of life on the farm.

The cabin completely private, but if you’d like to visit with family or friends there is another cabin located on the farm too. Check out our other listing for Valley View Cabin. You cannot see the other cabin, but it is located a couple hundred yards away.

You will have the entire cabin to yourself. You can go for a walk, enjoy the hot tub, grill out, roast marshmallows over the fire pit, or just rock on the front porch and take it easy.

We are available by phone (call or text) if you need anything.  We can offer suggestions of things to do while here (folder of information in the cabin). If we’re around we’d be happy to show you around the farm.

We are about a mile off of Hwy 16 (Back of the Dragon). About 10 miles from Hungry Mother State Park (hiking, fishing, beach swimming area...). We’re 25 minutes from Marion where there is an adorable Main Street with shops and eateries.  We are about 45 minutes from Abingdon (Barter Theatre, antique shopping, dining, winery...).

We are not near any public transportation.

We are about 25 minutes away from town. So, you may want to plan to stop at the grocery store on your way in. There are plenty of great restaurants in Marion. (We have a list of restaurants and activities to do while here.) FYI: Many of the Marion shops/restaurants are CLOSED on Mondays!

On our farm we raise and sell pastured beef, chicken, and pork. If you plan to cook while you are here let us know and you can order some homegrown meat ahead of time and we will have it waiting in your fridge. (Sausage or bacon for breakfast, steaks, hamburger, chicken breast, pork chops...) Bring a cooler so you can take some beef, chicken, and pork back home with you. You can see what's available and order directly through our website www.oldrichvalleyfarm dot com.","Hot tubs are very expensive.  We ask that you read and follow all rules of the hot tub (listed in the cabin) to make sure it doesn’t get damaged.

Private dock for fishing or docking your boat. Sleeps 6 comfortably.  Fully equipped kitchen and laundry. Located in a safe, quiet, rural neighborhood halfway between Charleston and Fayetteville. Convenient to outdoor recreational activities. Stay in and cook your own meals or visit a local eatery. No Pets Allowed!

Welcome to this delightful cottage nestled in the heart of the picturesque town of Boomer, WV . Perfectly situated in a serene and peaceful setting, this home offers a tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Quiet, kid friendly neighborhood. The cantilever deck overlooks the river which is about 30 steps away.  You can fish off of the dock or tie your boat up to it. Bring your kayaks or canoes and put them in right in front of the house! Beautiful fire pit with seating for 6, overlooking the river and scenic mountains!

Please take note that bedroom 1 (queen room) and bedroom 3 (twin w/trundle bed) share a closet. 

All bedrooms have a  24” smart TV and WIFI. 

The house is a 30 minute scenic drive along the historic Midland Trail to New River Gorge National Park and Preserve. You’ll pass a couple of waterfalls along the way so make a day of it! Fayetteville, voted “coolest small town”, is right along the route to New River Gorge and has many locally owned restaurants and breweries. It's also home of several adventure companies who offer hiking, biking, white water rafting, repelling, ATV riding, horseback riding & so much more! 

Charleston, the state’s capital, is about 40 minutes drive west.  

Summerville Lake State Park is roughly 36 miles from the cottage and offers a nice beach, boat rental, lighthouse and more. 

We hope you love WV and our little piece of Heaven on the river, as much as we do!

All rooms in the house are available for use. Washer and dryer are in the basement. Locked doors in the basement are off limits. 

Outbuilding is locked and unavailable.

We will give you all the space you need but we are only a few streets away if you have any questions or need assistance with something.

Close knit neighborhood. Owners live on another street in the same community. Friendly family atmosphere but being right on the river gives you privacy if you want it.

Street parking is available right next to the house. There is room for up to 4 vehicles. The house is in a rural community so there is no Uber. You need to plan to drive to get around. Neighborhood is friendly for a leisurely walk.

We are both lifelong residents of West Virginia and have lived in Fayetteville since 1984.

The Storybook Cottage is located just 5 miles from Fayetteville and the New River Gorge National Park Visitors Center.  This unique property is a perfect place to relax and unwind.  It's secluded, quiet and peacefully surrounded by mature forests and fields.   You can expect to encounter wildlife and a variety of native birds.  There's a spacious outdoor living area, complete with yard games, tree swing, grill, outdoor fire-pit with plenty of firewood, and a swim spa.  The indoor living area features a fully equipped kitchen with appliances, wares, amenities and essentials.  There's a great room with plenty of places to sit and relax.  Television is available in the great room and one of the bedrooms .  Laundry facilities are provided, as well.  There are two sleeping quarters, one with king bed and second with queen bed.  The floor-plan is unique, so it's important to note that you have to go through a bedroom to use the bathroom facilities.  Also, as the house is surrounded by fields and woods, you may occasionally see insects.  If you prefer a perfectly sterile environment, this house will not be a good fit.   

This is a nature lover's paradise.  Plan to rest, renew and unwind at ""The Storybook Cottage"" (Website hidden by Airbnb)

We have plenty of space and privacy. We can accommodate almost every truck trailer 5th wheel combo out there, and more than a couple at a time!

This property offers privacy and security for your family as well as your vehicles & UTV's. Not only is it perfect for UTV enthusiasts but families as well!

We typically let guests do self check in, sometimes my husband does like to meet the guests if he’s available when they arrive. We are here should any issues occur.

The cabin is close to the town but still secluded, a 24 hour gas station and restaurants are very close by.

The driveway is steep, any guest with a trailer will need a 4 wheel drive. Any large trailer will need to park on the flat right below the driveway. A 4wd is typically preferred but many cars have made it with no trouble. During the winter months of snow/ice should be present, access to the cabin could be difficult but parking and walking up is an option that others have done. We just like to make guests aware before arrival so they use their judgement.","See Rental Agreement for further info","We typically let guests do self check in, sometimes my husband does like to meet the guests if he’s available when they arrive.

The New York Times and CNN have published and produced different pieces highlighting the county and its unique way of life that still exists here in the mountains. Even the late chef, author, and documentarian, Anthony Bourdain spent time filming in McDowell and was quoted saying it was one of the most unique places he had traveled to.

This fully remodeled home is designed for riders that want more than a bunkhouse and prefer a more intimate setting like being in your own home.  This home is less than a half mile to the Devil Anse trail head and 1 mile from downtown Matewan. Fix your meals in the stocked kitchen or on the Blackstone Griddle, or eat at one of Matewan's restaurants! This home is designed for a maximum  6 guests. Please request host approval for anything different.

3 bedrooms - 4 beds
2 bathrooms
Kitchen, living, dining, and laundry rooms
Large parking area for 3 vehicles with trailers.

Full access to the entire home and it’s property with exception of cleaners closet.

We make every effort to be available for questions via the app and by text message.

This area of Matewan is known as “Hatfield Bottom”

No need to trailer, ride your SXS everywhere!

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. No parties or events may be held at the Loft or on the property. 
2. No overnight guests other than those registered and approved when making the reservation online. If you are expecting visitors for a short period of time during your stay, please let your hosts know.
3. No pets are permitted without prior permission and with an additional pet charge of $25 per pet (maximum one large dog or two small dogs). Sorry, no cats are permitted ever. We have four (friendly) dogs so we will need to coordinate yard usage to avoid any possible problems. Please clean up after your pet! Pets may not be left unattended for more than 2 hours and must be in a kennel/travel carrier. If you need assistance finding a dog-sitter please contact your hosts ahead of time.
4. Trash cans and bags are provided in the Loft (under the sink in the kitchen and bathroom). If the cans get full during your stay, please take the trash out and put in one of the trash cans in, or by, the driveway. No need to take out the trash at the end of your stay.
5. No hair dying or coloring is permitted in the Loft.
6. We do not have child safety features; children are welcome if you accept liability and are comfortable knowing we have no child proofing along with many stairs.
7. Minors under the age of 18 must be accompanied, in person AT ALL TIMES, by an adult over 21. You must be 21 to book a reservation at the Loft.
8. The antler hooks by the door will not hold heavy loads. Please only hang light jackets and clothing on them.
9. Please clean your boots/shoes as well as you can before entering the building and use the boot tray upstairs by the door for your boots and shoes.
10. Please do not block neighbor’s driveways, including the apartment’s next door. We will do what we can to help you with parking (including our driveway and street parking in front of our house). Please let us know if you’re traveling with a trailer so we can help you plan for parking.
11. If you would like to sit outside, you are welcome to use the camp chairs at the bottom of the stairs. If it is raining or too sunny, feel free to sit under the carport by the house. If we are parked there, just send us a message during daytime hours (9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) and we’ll move our car: we want you to enjoy your stay! You can also sit in the backyard but be aware that our dogs will occasionally need to be let out. If you are using the yard and/or grill, we will check with you before letting out the dogs. When sitting outside after 9 p.m. please try to keep the noise down so as not to disturb the residents and neighbors.
12. Do not go out on the roof. While it looks like a great place to hang out, it’s not safe for people and walking on the shingles are likely to cause damage.
13. Without exception, no smoking, vaping or marijuana usage inside the Loft. Please don’t think it can be covered up, it cannot. We have to extensively clean to remove the contaminant before other guests can arrive. Neutralizing this contaminant inside requires a $100 minimum service fee. Feel free to step outside in the back yard and quietly enjoy a tobacco smoke or vape; you'll just need to police your butts.
14. Before you leave, please wash any dishes that you used. Clean dishes can be left in the drainer to dry and we’ll put them away.
15. No need to strip the bed or pile up used towels and washcloths upon departure but during your stay, please hang wet towels and washcloths on the towel racks, shower curtain rod or side of the bathtub.
16. Please lock the door at the bottom of the steps whenever you leave the premises, including your departure.

The Foggy Mountain Loft has the feel of a mountain hideaway but in town, close to where you want to play & eat. There's a private entrance to this simple guest loft above the garage behind our home. You'll find a basic kitchenette, full bathroom, Roku TV and WiFi. At over 50 years old, the Loft shows its age with multiple layers of paint and years of cosmetic repairs, but it has been recently renovated to create a safe, clean & comfortable space.

The Foggy Mountain Loft is a single L-shaped room which has a double bed, futon couch, and a full bathroom with bathtub and shower. You can use our Adirondack chairs to spend time outside or stay in and watch your streaming apps on the Roku TV. There isn't a stove or oven in the Loft but there is a microwave, coffee maker, hot water kettle, toaster, air fryer and electric skillet for simple food preparation, and a grill in the garage you can use upon request.  There are also many great restaurants in Logan just a few minutes away.

Foggy Mountain Loft is on a residential street near town with free on-street parking. If you're towing a trailer, we'll try to save the spaces in front of the house for you with prior arrangement or you can use our driveway. You'll have a private entrance to the Loft at the end of the driveway with access through a digital keypad deadbolt lock.

We're available during your stay for assistance or to answer questions but you'll have as much privacy as you're looking for.

There are many places to eat in Logan and a lot of things to do:

Chief Logan State Park: 5.6 miles
Chief Logan Recreation Center: 8.2 miles
Dunks Body Shop (Gym): 12.5 miles
H & M Bearwallow Trail connector: 1 mile
H & M Bearwallow Trailhead: 4.1 miles
H & M Rockhouse Trailhead: 13.8 miles
H & M Buffalo Mountain Trailhead: 28 miles
H & M Devil Anse Trailhead: 34.6 miles

Gas station (which usually has the cheapest gas in Logan) is just about a mile away (just past the coffee house and bakery...)!

On street parking is easy to find near Foggy Mountain Loft. If you're raveling with a trailer you'll be able to find a spot within a couple blocks of the Loft. With prior arrangement, guests traveling with a trailer can have the parking spaces in front of  our house saved by us until their arrival or can park in the driveway (pulling truck into carport, there's room for a trailer with one ATV).

This is a 2nd floor loft with a narrow staircase, so you'll need to keep an eye on small children and keep in mind your own ability to climb stairs.","1. No parties or events may be held at the Loft or on the property. 
2. No overnight guests other than those registered and approved when making the reservation online. If you are expecting visitors for a short period of time during your stay, please let your hosts know.
3. No pets are permitted without prior permission and with an additional pet charge of $25 per pet (maximum one large dog or two small dogs). Sorry, no cats are permitted ever. We have four (friendly) dogs so we will need to coordinate yard usage to avoid any possible problems. Please clean up after your pet! Pets may not be left unattended for more than 2 hours and must be in a kennel/travel carrier. If you need assistance finding a dog-sitter please contact your hosts ahead of time.
4. Trash cans and bags are provided in the Loft (under the sink in the kitchen and bathroom). If the cans get full during your stay, please take the trash out and put in one of the trash cans in, or by, the driveway. No need to take out the trash at the end of your stay.
5. No hair dying or coloring is permitted in the Loft.
6. We do not have child safety features; children are welcome if you accept liability and are comfortable knowing we have no child proofing along with many stairs.
7. Minors under the age of 18 must be accompanied, in person AT ALL TIMES, by an adult over 21. You must be 21 to book a reservation at the Loft.
8. The antler hooks by the door will not hold heavy loads. Please only hang light jackets and clothing on them.
9. Please clean your boots/shoes as well as you can before entering the building and use the boot tray upstairs by the door for your boots and shoes.
10. Please do not block neighbor’s driveways, including the apartment’s next door. We will do what we can to help you with parking (including our driveway and street parking in front of our house). Please let us know if you’re traveling with a trailer so we can help you plan for parking.
11. If you would like to sit outside, you are welcome to use the camp chairs at the bottom of the stairs. If it is raining or too sunny, feel free to sit under the carport by the house. If we are parked there, just send us a message during daytime hours (9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) and we’ll move our car: we want you to enjoy your stay! You can also sit in the backyard but be aware that our dogs will occasionally need to be let out. If you are using the yard and/or grill, we will check with you before letting out the dogs. When sitting outside after 9 p.m. please try to keep the noise down so as not to disturb the residents and neighbors.
12. Do not go out on the roof. While it looks like a great place to hang out, it’s not safe for people and walking on the shingles are likely to cause damage.
13. Without exception, no smoking, vaping or marijuana usage inside the Loft. Please don’t think it can be covered up, it cannot. We have to extensively clean to remove the contaminant before other guests can arrive. Neutralizing this contaminant inside requires a $100 minimum service fee. Feel free to step outside in the back yard and quietly enjoy a tobacco smoke or vape; you'll just need to police your butts.
14. Before you leave, please wash any dishes that you used. Clean dishes can be left in the drainer to dry and we’ll put them away.
15. No need to strip the bed or pile up used towels and washcloths upon departure but during your stay, please hang wet towels and washcloths on the towel racks, shower curtain rod or side of the bathtub.
16. Please lock the door at the bottom of the steps whenever you leave the premises, including your departure.","We're available during your stay for assistance or to answer questions but you'll have as much privacy as you're looking for.","en","English","Foggy Mountain Loft near Hatfield & McCoy Trails","There are many places to eat in Logan and a lot of things to do:

The newly-remodeled home offers two bedrooms and one bathroom, with additional sleeping in the living room.   The kitchen has concrete countertops and soft-close cabinets.  A Dollar General store is 1/4 mile away, and we have parking for ATV's.

All of the work on this apartment was completed by 120+ volunteers from 10+ states in 2018-2019.  As Covid-19 has ended the mentoring internship program typically hosted in this housing, we are turning over a new leaf.
