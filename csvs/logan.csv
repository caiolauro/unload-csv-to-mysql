Covid control notice:  to ensure a sanitized air environment for our guests and property personnel, we have installed dual zone RGF REME and Air Guardian units.  We are the first and only known location in the state of WV at this time having this level of air purification with these quality USA made devices.  We have used it for years but this year we increased to dual-zone. We are also committed to proper cleaning and laundering, but this additional REME step puts our location in a class of its own for respiratory health and protection.  We are already located in an area having exceptionally low case counts.  More than socially distance yourself in West Virginia - the mountains that surround us became our protection.   In our opinion, the mature hardwood trees on steep mountain sides create dense levels of fresh oxygen that cannot exist in flat city landscapes, if think about it. 

Statement from RGF:   The Guardian Air QR+ utilizes RGF’s patented PHI-Cell® technology and is easily mounted onto your existing air conditioning and heating system air ducts. When the HVAC system is in operation, the Guardian QR+ creates an advanced oxidation plasma (AOP) that is distributed through the duct system into the conditioning living space. Unlike passive air technologies, which need pollutants to pass through the unit for purification or filtration, the Guardian QR+ sweeps through our home actively purifying pollutants at the source. The advanced oxidation plasma consists of hydro-peroxides, oxide ions and hydroxide ions. All are friendly oxidizers that are found in nature’s process of cleaning the outdoor air and are safe for humans and animals alike.

The Guardian QR+ is an air purifier.   It does not reduce particulate matter like dust - but the AC deep pleat filters do. We have added a REME HALO for air purifier with added particulate reduction and that is even more effective at removing these allergens. 

REME HALO 
 Dual ionizers to reduce airborne particulates (dust, dander, pollen, mold spores)
• Kills up to 99% of bacteria, mold and viruses
• REME® reduces sneeze germs by 99% in the time a sneeze can reach three feet.
• New zinc ions kill 99% of viruses on surfaces
• Unlike portable units that are limited to the room in which they are placed, the REME HALO® provides whole home and building purification.
• Easily integrated with your existing HVAC system. The unit doesn’t take away living space and operates silently.
• Incorporates an adjustable REME® cell, which allows customization of the advanced oxidation plasma output.

We have ran these units at Chapmanville for 3 years now and for an additional 8 years in other residences of our and our family members.  

further RGF info: 
U.S. Military approved for mold reduction in field hospitals.
• U.S. and International Hospital approval for the fight against infectious diseases: 99% reduction of Staph (MRSA).
• Major U.S. city school test reports 20% reduction in absenteeism.
• Tested and approved by Asian Government for protection against the deadly SARS virus.
• Approved by the USDA, FSIS, and FDA for use in food processing plants. Employed to reduce microbial contamination of food being processed.
• Cruise lines use it as a safety measure against Norwalk Virus outbreaks.

The REME HALO® is installed in a wide variety of residential, commercial and industrial applications where a ducted HVAC system exists. Here are some examples:
• Single family homes, apartments, condos
• In hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and doctor’s offices
• Schools, daycare centers, colleges and universities
• Fitness centers, locker rooms, athletic facilities
• Office buildings
• Veterinary clinics, animal hospitals, kennels,
• Hotels, motels, and resorts.
• Food processing and manufacturing plants/facilities
• Restaurants, diners, and bars

We utilize two Wifi heat pump thermostats to maintain a set temperature range for the two systems.  It is remotely managed.  The fall/winter heat pump default is 70Heat-73AC.  If you run colder in the winter let us know and we can adjust it down to 68Heat-72AC a day before check in.  We also leave a out dehumidifier out downstairs (please help by emptying into downstairs sink or bathtub) to keep humidity down lower, its easy and takes 1 minute.

Please note - in general we dont accept guests with 0 reviews or unverified status.  For those new to airbnb, all guests must submit a valid photo ID along with full name and reply to this request with clear photos send  inside the Airbnb app within 24 hours of booking.

Entire house.  Each room has an available closet and dressers.  There are two bathrooms upstairs and one downstairs.  The master bedroom has its own complete bathroom with a standing shower with a separate personal bathtub-4 jet Jacuzzi that fills and then drains after each use.

The property manager is nearby and accessible.  We also have a 2-way-talk/video RING doorbell on the front porch to contact our cellphones directly 24 hours a day.  The area has good Wifi coverage of 5g and 2.4g with AC/MIMO.  Wifi password is available on request for guests and provided in the guest document after the reservation is complete.

The neighborhood is rural-country.   We are on a hill above a nice flat.   Its a big home that can hold a large family or group of friends.  

The area is very pretty and also WV upscale.  Although it is rural, its still about 30min to s. charleston and about 15 min to super=big box stores that have expanded to our county.  highway 119 that connects us to town is a nice, well kept divided 4 lane highway.  We do have former governors on the street that retired to the area because of its charm and privacy.   Its one of the best kept secrets of WV.

In WV coalfield counties (Logan, Mingo, Boone,Lincoln...) you can drive on ATV or UTV marked streets legally to and from trailheads and into small towns (provided you have a valid HMT sticker on your helmet and you obey traffic laws).  You cannot drive a non-plated ATV/UTV on a divided 4-lane highway like RT 119 or the new interstate 4 lane section of rt 10 from logan to man (okay to safely cross it, just dont drive down the highway like cars do).  The old Rt10 is still there and that is ATV okay.  Many towns in SW West Virginia ( AKA the Devil's Den) are offroad-friendly - driving is a privilege, not a right - so be respectful.  Bring a Harley AND your UTV -- because our blacktop road are just as fun as our offroad trails.  Tow your Harley here with your JEEP and have the best of both worlds.  If you are riding from town to a trailhead on the backroads or into town - make CERTAIN you have a valid HMT decal on the helmet left side and your matching drivers license.   Many local gas stations sell the HMT annual permit stickers (eg. Lil Gen/Burger King @ 100 Old Co 3/3 Rd, Chapmanville, WV 25508) and there are also a few welcome centers on 119 always having stickers available.  Active Military ID from any state will get you the HMT in-state rates at the welcome center!   Also remember WV is a helmet-required state when riding on the road !

We recommend downloading a good GPS App with Topo on your phone.  Note that since “location” GPS is turned on inside your phone this consumes battery at a faster rate - so USB power batteries are a wise investment.  The apps and maps you download are not small files, so download them first on wifi and you might need to clear off or expand SD memory cards.   Sample apps:  I hike gps: topo,  maps 3D pro,  GPS tracks.   We have good wifi at the house to download these files/apps.  You probably wont have LTE cellular on the trail, so download them at home or at the 5G tower base at the Chapmanville Rt10 exit.  

G00gle maps and apple’s maps have topographical (topo) features but they dont record your trail like a GPS tracker app.  Both maps would need to be downloaded before your journey..

Country Roads Byways Visitors Center and Jeep Trailhead / Chapmanville /  12 minutes on i-119  Or 8 miles on backroads without using a trailer from the house.  This HMT trailhead allows Jeeps/RangeRovers in addition to UTV/ATV/MX.  It’s near logan/chapmanville superwalmart.  It has over 100 miles of mountain Green and Blue trails that can be navigated with a stock Jeep wrangler unlimited, weather permitting over a long weekend.  It has another 50 miles of black-dot expert trails require external cage structure installed on the Jeep.   They are serious rock-crawling level trails that are best with an extra  person navigating and often marking outside the truck, front/rear winch, lift & articulation kits. Expect body dents and severe levels of drive-train stress on black dot Jeep trails.  You may get a few paint scratches on far ends of blue dot trails, but green trails only need 4wd locked out in a few sections or if its really wet.  WV trails are very steep and drain off quickly.  The day after rain has firm soil with ideal conditions.  During rain is challenging and slick.  A run with snow is also ideal, due to the beauty of the mountains !!!

Rural WV Communication:  when at the house, plan to coordinate contacting your away crew over our WiFi connection with apps like: Whats App, Text, e-Mail, WiFi-Calling, VOIP,  Messenger, GoogleVoice...   Although we have steady high speed WiFi inside the house and around it, expect that cellular service is weak when your more than a mile off 119.  There is a powerful cell tower 2 miles away (i-119 in chapmanville), but most use our home wifi to connect.   5G cellular on the T-mobile network was installed 3/2020 on a mountain tower between our road and downtown Chapmanville.  We are on the edge of the signal - some phones pick up, others wont.   We do have gigabyte level service inside the house that is available for guest use on our dual bands 5G and 2.4G WiFi networks.

Also, we have backroad access to the Chapmanville Rt3 connector for bear wallow.  Its about 6 miles of scenic backroads on ATV, no trailering.  That’s the fastest way to access HMT and from there you can also connect through 2-3 other systems all the way to Kentucky.  Its a lot of riding.  

Trailer-only with no trail-to-trail connections for systems at Country Roads, and Warrior.   Country Roads is the nearest pass store @ 12 miles/12 min and the main trailer lot for Bear Wallow is 4 miles past that.  Check current covid regs in effect.  There is also a local gas station even closer with hours from 5am to midnight to buy the helmet  sticker pass.  that we can usually arrange with that gas station manager to hold and keep stickers on hand for our guests, upon an advance request.

Note that since “location” GPS is turned on inside your phone this consumes battery at a faster rate - so USB power batteries are a wise investment.  The apps and maps you download are not small files, so download them first on wifi and you might need to clear off or expand SD memory cards.   Sample apps:  I hike gps: topo,  maps 3D pro,  GPS tracks.   We have good wifi at the house to download these files/apps.  You probably wont have LTE cellular on the trail, so download them at home or at the 5G tower base at the Chapmanville Rt10 exit.  

G00gle maps and apple’s maps have topographical (topo) features but they dont record your trail like a GPS tracker app.  Both maps would need to be downloaded before your journey..

Country Roads Byways Visitors Center and Jeep Trailhead / Chapmanville /  12 minutes on i-119  Or 8 miles on backroads without using a trailer from the house.  This HMT trailhead allows Jeeps/RangeRovers in addition to UTV/ATV/MX.  It’s near logan/chapmanville superwalmart.  It has over 100 miles of mountain Green and Blue trails that can be navigated with a stock Jeep wrangler unlimited, weather permitting over a long weekend.  It has another 50 miles of black-dot expert trails require external cage structure installed on the Jeep.   They are serious rock-crawling level trails that are best with an extra  person navigating and often marking outside the truck, front/rear winch, lift & articulation kits. Expect body dents and severe levels of drive-train stress on black dot Jeep trails.  You may get a few paint scratches on far ends of blue dot trails, but green trails only need 4wd locked out in a few sections or if its really wet.  WV trails are very steep and drain off quickly.  The day after rain has firm soil with ideal conditions.  During rain is challenging and slick.  A run with snow is also ideal, due to the beauty of the mountains !!!","41","45","61","77","665",,,,"pdp_m2_5_bathroom","","Bathroom","40","44","46","73","85","86","671",,,,,"pdp_m2_5_bedroom_laundry","","Bedroom and laundry","1",,,,,"pdp_m2_5_entertainment","","Entertainment","392",,,,,"pdp_m2_5_family","","Family","5","30","139",,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_heating_cooling","","Heating and cooling","35","36","37","39",,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_home_safety","","Home safety","4","47",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_internet_office","","Internet and office","8","89","90","91","92","93","94","95","96","145","236","251","308","625","626","672",,"pdp_m2_5_kitchen_dining","","Kitchen and dining","57","132","663",,,,"pdp_m2_5_location","","Location features","99","100","101","179","280",,"pdp_m2_5_outdoor","","Outdoor","9","23","25",,"pdp_m2_5_parking_facilities","","Parking and facilities","53","104",,,"pdp_m2_5_services","","Services","33","34",,"pdp_unavailable","","Not included","false","4.79","WV","0","https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/27570697"

Great location for traveling healthcare professionals or anyone interested in work in the nearby towns. 
No smoking or pets allowed.

I have a no pet policy and this includes service animals because I have allergies. I take daily prescribed medicines plus monthly allergy shots. I love animals but I am the one who cleans the apartment.

A blacktop parking area is available in front of the apartment. This area is shared with the 1st floor guest.

If your stay is during the summer you may hear the lawn mower or weed eater. 

This is a very safe place to stay. My last two bookings were traveling healthcare professionals who worked at Pikeville Medical during their stay. I have had many long term stays. There is a built in discount for stays of 28 days or longer.","Wash dishes and put back where they were.

There is truly no other place like Welch, WV. Once a booming coal town, Welch now has a much smaller population. Welch and McDowell County have garnered much attention over the past decade. The New York Times and CNN have published and produced different pieces highlighting the county and its unique way of life that still exists here in the mountains. Even the late chef, author, and documentarian, Anthony Bourdain spent time filming in McDowell and was quoted saying it was one of the most unique places he had traveled to.

The driveway is steep, any guest with a trailer will need a 4 wheel drive. Any large trailer will need to park on the flat right below the driveway. A 4wd is typically preferred but many cars have made it with no trouble. During the winter months of snow/ice should be present, access to the cabin could be difficult but parking and walking up is an option that others have done.

We run a ministry (A New Beginning) located downtown. 
We opened A Bit of Heaven Rental in Sept. 2018 when the trails opened in our area. We currently have 5 units we rent. We also opened A Scoop of Heaven Icecream in 2021.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. No parties or events may be held at the Loft or on the property. 
2. No overnight guests other than those registered and approved when making the reservation online. If you are expecting visitors for a short period of time during your stay, please let your hosts know.
3. No pets are permitted without prior permission and with an additional pet charge of $25 per pet (maximum one large dog or two small dogs). Sorry, no cats are permitted ever. We have four (friendly) dogs so we will need to coordinate yard usage to avoid any possible problems. Please clean up after your pet! Pets may not be left unattended for more than 2 hours and must be in a kennel/travel carrier. If you need assistance finding a dog-sitter please contact your hosts ahead of time.
4. Trash cans and bags are provided in the Loft (under the sink in the kitchen and bathroom). If the cans get full during your stay, please take the trash out and put in one of the trash cans in, or by, the driveway. No need to take out the trash at the end of your stay.
5. No hair dying or coloring is permitted in the Loft.
6. We do not have child safety features; children are welcome if you accept liability and are comfortable knowing we have no child proofing along with many stairs.
7. Minors under the age of 18 must be accompanied, in person AT ALL TIMES, by an adult over 21. You must be 21 to book a reservation at the Loft.
8. The antler hooks by the door will not hold heavy loads. Please only hang light jackets and clothing on them.
9. Please clean your boots/shoes as well as you can before entering the building and use the boot tray upstairs by the door for your boots and shoes.
10. Please do not block neighbor’s driveways, including the apartment’s next door. We will do what we can to help you with parking (including our driveway and street parking in front of our house). Please let us know if you’re traveling with a trailer so we can help you plan for parking.
11. If you would like to sit outside, you are welcome to use the camp chairs at the bottom of the stairs. If it is raining or too sunny, feel free to sit under the carport by the house. If we are parked there, just send us a message during daytime hours (9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) and we’ll move our car: we want you to enjoy your stay! You can also sit in the backyard but be aware that our dogs will occasionally need to be let out. If you are using the yard and/or grill, we will check with you before letting out the dogs. When sitting outside after 9 p.m. please try to keep the noise down so as not to disturb the residents and neighbors.
12. Do not go out on the roof. While it looks like a great place to hang out, it’s not safe for people and walking on the shingles are likely to cause damage.
13. Without exception, no smoking, vaping or marijuana usage inside the Loft. Please don’t think it can be covered up, it cannot. We have to extensively clean to remove the contaminant before other guests can arrive. Neutralizing this contaminant inside requires a $100 minimum service fee. Feel free to step outside in the back yard and quietly enjoy a tobacco smoke or vape; you'll just need to police your butts.
14. Before you leave, please wash any dishes that you used. Clean dishes can be left in the drainer to dry and we’ll put them away.
15. No need to strip the bed or pile up used towels and washcloths upon departure but during your stay, please hang wet towels and washcloths on the towel racks, shower curtain rod or side of the bathtub.
16. Please lock the door at the bottom of the steps whenever you leave the premises, including your departure.

The Foggy Mountain Loft has the feel of a mountain hideaway but in town, close to where you want to play & eat. There's a private entrance to this simple guest loft above the garage behind our home. You'll find a basic kitchenette, full bathroom, Roku TV and WiFi. At over 50 years old, the Loft shows its age with multiple layers of paint and years of cosmetic repairs, but it has been recently renovated to create a safe, clean & comfortable space.

The Foggy Mountain Loft is a single L-shaped room which has a double bed, futon couch, and a full bathroom with bathtub and shower. You can use our Adirondack chairs to spend time outside or stay in and watch your streaming apps on the Roku TV. There isn't a stove or oven in the Loft but there is a microwave, coffee maker, hot water kettle, toaster, air fryer and electric skillet for simple food preparation, and a grill in the garage you can use upon request.  There are also many great restaurants in Logan just a few minutes away.

Foggy Mountain Loft is on a residential street near town with free on-street parking. If you're towing a trailer, we'll try to save the spaces in front of the house for you with prior arrangement or you can use our driveway. You'll have a private entrance to the Loft at the end of the driveway with access through a digital keypad deadbolt lock.

We're available during your stay for assistance or to answer questions but you'll have as much privacy as you're looking for.

There are many places to eat in Logan and a lot of things to do:

Chief Logan State Park: 5.6 miles
Chief Logan Recreation Center: 8.2 miles
Dunks Body Shop (Gym): 12.5 miles
H & M Bearwallow Trail connector: 1 mile
H & M Bearwallow Trailhead: 4.1 miles
H & M Rockhouse Trailhead: 13.8 miles
H & M Buffalo Mountain Trailhead: 28 miles
H & M Devil Anse Trailhead: 34.6 miles

Gas station (which usually has the cheapest gas in Logan) is just about a mile away (just past the coffee house and bakery...)!

On street parking is easy to find near Foggy Mountain Loft. If you're raveling with a trailer you'll be able to find a spot within a couple blocks of the Loft. With prior arrangement, guests traveling with a trailer can have the parking spaces in front of  our house saved by us until their arrival or can park in the driveway (pulling truck into carport, there's room for a trailer with one ATV).

This is a 2nd floor loft with a narrow staircase, so you'll need to keep an eye on small children and keep in mind your own ability to climb stairs.","1. No parties or events may be held at the Loft or on the property. 
2. No overnight guests other than those registered and approved when making the reservation online. If you are expecting visitors for a short period of time during your stay, please let your hosts know.
3. No pets are permitted without prior permission and with an additional pet charge of $25 per pet (maximum one large dog or two small dogs). Sorry, no cats are permitted ever. We have four (friendly) dogs so we will need to coordinate yard usage to avoid any possible problems. Please clean up after your pet! Pets may not be left unattended for more than 2 hours and must be in a kennel/travel carrier. If you need assistance finding a dog-sitter please contact your hosts ahead of time.
4. Trash cans and bags are provided in the Loft (under the sink in the kitchen and bathroom). If the cans get full during your stay, please take the trash out and put in one of the trash cans in, or by, the driveway. No need to take out the trash at the end of your stay.
5. No hair dying or coloring is permitted in the Loft.
6. We do not have child safety features; children are welcome if you accept liability and are comfortable knowing we have no child proofing along with many stairs.
7. Minors under the age of 18 must be accompanied, in person AT ALL TIMES, by an adult over 21. You must be 21 to book a reservation at the Loft.
8. The antler hooks by the door will not hold heavy loads. Please only hang light jackets and clothing on them.
9. Please clean your boots/shoes as well as you can before entering the building and use the boot tray upstairs by the door for your boots and shoes.
10. Please do not block neighbor’s driveways, including the apartment’s next door. We will do what we can to help you with parking (including our driveway and street parking in front of our house). Please let us know if you’re traveling with a trailer so we can help you plan for parking.
11. If you would like to sit outside, you are welcome to use the camp chairs at the bottom of the stairs. If it is raining or too sunny, feel free to sit under the carport by the house. If we are parked there, just send us a message during daytime hours (9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) and we’ll move our car: we want you to enjoy your stay! You can also sit in the backyard but be aware that our dogs will occasionally need to be let out. If you are using the yard and/or grill, we will check with you before letting out the dogs. When sitting outside after 9 p.m. please try to keep the noise down so as not to disturb the residents and neighbors.
12. Do not go out on the roof. While it looks like a great place to hang out, it’s not safe for people and walking on the shingles are likely to cause damage.
13. Without exception, no smoking, vaping or marijuana usage inside the Loft. Please don’t think it can be covered up, it cannot. We have to extensively clean to remove the contaminant before other guests can arrive. Neutralizing this contaminant inside requires a $100 minimum service fee. Feel free to step outside in the back yard and quietly enjoy a tobacco smoke or vape; you'll just need to police your butts.
14. Before you leave, please wash any dishes that you used. Clean dishes can be left in the drainer to dry and we’ll put them away.
15. No need to strip the bed or pile up used towels and washcloths upon departure but during your stay, please hang wet towels and washcloths on the towel racks, shower curtain rod or side of the bathtub.
16. Please lock the door at the bottom of the steps whenever you leave the premises, including your departure.","We're available during your stay for assistance or to answer questions but you'll have as much privacy as you're looking for.","en","English","Foggy Mountain Loft near Hatfield & McCoy Trails","There are many places to eat in Logan and a lot of things to do:
