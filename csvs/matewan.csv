We typically let guests do self check in, sometimes my husband does like to meet the guests if he’s available when they arrive. We are here should any issues occur.

The cabin is close to the town but still secluded, a 24 hour gas station and restaurants are very close by.

The driveway is steep, any guest with a trailer will need a 4 wheel drive. Any large trailer will need to park on the flat right below the driveway. A 4wd is typically preferred but many cars have made it with no trouble. During the winter months of snow/ice should be present, access to the cabin could be difficult but parking and walking up is an option that others have done. We just like to make guests aware before arrival so they use their judgement.","See Rental Agreement for further info","We typically let guests do self check in, sometimes my husband does like to meet the guests if he’s available when they arrive.

Guest have access to the entire apartment.  If you continue walking down the common hallway of the building there is a stairway that leads to a second entrance directly onto Main Street (best way to access the restaurants downtown).

I will not be personally meeting guests for check in but if guests should need anything at all they can call, text, or email at anytime, day or night, and I will assist in anyway I can.

With this unit being located right in the center of downtown, you're within a short walking distance of all restaurants and businesses located on Main Street.  There are 4 restaurants/bars, a moonshine distillery, and many other businesses to visit while in town.

Whitesburg is a small little town and there aren't any local cab companies to get around but you shouldn't have a problem finding anything on your own.  If you have any questions on how to get somewhere or things to do just send me a text and I'll help you out.

Parking for this unit is behind the building located on Hayes Street.  There are 4 spots directly behind the building and then 6 Long parking spots to the side of the building with ""permit parking only"" signs.  You are welcome to park in any of those spaces that are available.  You can also park in the parking lot just down the hill between Whitaker Bank and Community Trust Bank and also in any of the parallel parking spaces located on Main Street.  The double glass entry doors to the building are located right next to the parking lot on Hayes Street and you'll see the ""Apartments on Main"" logo on the entry door.","Absolutely No Smoking

Please take note that bedroom 1 (queen room) and bedroom 3 (twin w/trundle bed) share a closet. 

All bedrooms have a  24” smart TV and WIFI. 

The house is a 30 minute scenic drive along the historic Midland Trail to New River Gorge National Park and Preserve. You’ll pass a couple of waterfalls along the way so make a day of it! Fayetteville, voted “coolest small town”, is right along the route to New River Gorge and has many locally owned restaurants and breweries. It's also home of several adventure companies who offer hiking, biking, white water rafting, repelling, ATV riding, horseback riding & so much more! 

Charleston, the state’s capital, is about 40 minutes drive west.  

Summerville Lake State Park is roughly 36 miles from the cottage and offers a nice beach, boat rental, lighthouse and more. 

We hope you love WV and our little piece of Heaven on the river, as much as we do!

The cabin is located on a working family farm. You can purchase beef, pork, and chicken to cook while you’re here or bring a cooler and take some home.

Take a break from life. Get away. Come relax in solitude or with your spouse. Reconnect with nature. Breathe in that fresh air. Observe wildlife and get a taste of life on the farm.

The cabin completely private, but if you’d like to visit with family or friends there is another cabin located on the farm too. Check out our other listing for Valley View Cabin. You cannot see the other cabin, but it is located a couple hundred yards away.

You will have the entire cabin to yourself. You can go for a walk, enjoy the hot tub, grill out, roast marshmallows over the fire pit, or just rock on the front porch and take it easy.

We are available by phone (call or text) if you need anything.  We can offer suggestions of things to do while here (folder of information in the cabin). If we’re around we’d be happy to show you around the farm.

We are about a mile off of Hwy 16 (Back of the Dragon). About 10 miles from Hungry Mother State Park (hiking, fishing, beach swimming area...). We’re 25 minutes from Marion where there is an adorable Main Street with shops and eateries.  We are about 45 minutes from Abingdon (Barter Theatre, antique shopping, dining, winery...).

We are not near any public transportation.

We are about 25 minutes away from town. So, you may want to plan to stop at the grocery store on your way in. There are plenty of great restaurants in Marion. (We have a list of restaurants and activities to do while here.) FYI: Many of the Marion shops/restaurants are CLOSED on Mondays!

On our farm we raise and sell pastured beef, chicken, and pork. If you plan to cook while you are here let us know and you can order some homegrown meat ahead of time and we will have it waiting in your fridge. (Sausage or bacon for breakfast, steaks, hamburger, chicken breast, pork chops...) Bring a cooler so you can take some beef, chicken, and pork back home with you. You can see what's available and order directly through our website www.oldrichvalleyfarm dot com.","Hot tubs are very expensive.  We ask that you read and follow all rules of the hot tub (listed in the cabin) to make sure it doesn’t get damaged.  

This is a working farm. We ask that you are very careful around the animals and stay off of all farm equipment.","We are available by phone (call or text) if you need anything.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. No parties or events may be held at the Loft or on the property. 
2. No overnight guests other than those registered and approved when making the reservation online. If you are expecting visitors for a short period of time during your stay, please let your hosts know.
3. No pets are permitted without prior permission and with an additional pet charge of $25 per pet (maximum one large dog or two small dogs). Sorry, no cats are permitted ever. We have four (friendly) dogs so we will need to coordinate yard usage to avoid any possible problems. Please clean up after your pet! Pets may not be left unattended for more than 2 hours and must be in a kennel/travel carrier. If you need assistance finding a dog-sitter please contact your hosts ahead of time.
4. Trash cans and bags are provided in the Loft (under the sink in the kitchen and bathroom). If the cans get full during your stay, please take the trash out and put in one of the trash cans in, or by, the driveway. No need to take out the trash at the end of your stay.
5. No hair dying or coloring is permitted in the Loft.
6. We do not have child safety features; children are welcome if you accept liability and are comfortable knowing we have no child proofing along with many stairs.
7. Minors under the age of 18 must be accompanied, in person AT ALL TIMES, by an adult over 21. You must be 21 to book a reservation at the Loft.
8. The antler hooks by the door will not hold heavy loads. Please only hang light jackets and clothing on them.
9. Please clean your boots/shoes as well as you can before entering the building and use the boot tray upstairs by the door for your boots and shoes.
10. Please do not block neighbor’s driveways, including the apartment’s next door. We will do what we can to help you with parking (including our driveway and street parking in front of our house). Please let us know if you’re traveling with a trailer so we can help you plan for parking.
11. If you would like to sit outside, you are welcome to use the camp chairs at the bottom of the stairs. If it is raining or too sunny, feel free to sit under the carport by the house. If we are parked there, just send us a message during daytime hours (9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) and we’ll move our car: we want you to enjoy your stay! You can also sit in the backyard but be aware that our dogs will occasionally need to be let out. If you are using the yard and/or grill, we will check with you before letting out the dogs. When sitting outside after 9 p.m. please try to keep the noise down so as not to disturb the residents and neighbors.
12. Do not go out on the roof. While it looks like a great place to hang out, it’s not safe for people and walking on the shingles are likely to cause damage.
13. Without exception, no smoking, vaping or marijuana usage inside the Loft. Please don’t think it can be covered up, it cannot. We have to extensively clean to remove the contaminant before other guests can arrive. Neutralizing this contaminant inside requires a $100 minimum service fee. Feel free to step outside in the back yard and quietly enjoy a tobacco smoke or vape; you'll just need to police your butts.
14. Before you leave, please wash any dishes that you used. Clean dishes can be left in the drainer to dry and we’ll put them away.
15. No need to strip the bed or pile up used towels and washcloths upon departure but during your stay, please hang wet towels and washcloths on the towel racks, shower curtain rod or side of the bathtub.
16. Please lock the door at the bottom of the steps whenever you leave the premises, including your departure.

The Foggy Mountain Loft has the feel of a mountain hideaway but in town, close to where you want to play & eat. There's a private entrance to this simple guest loft above the garage behind our home. You'll find a basic kitchenette, full bathroom, Roku TV and WiFi. At over 50 years old, the Loft shows its age with multiple layers of paint and years of cosmetic repairs, but it has been recently renovated to create a safe, clean & comfortable space.

The Foggy Mountain Loft is a single L-shaped room which has a double bed, futon couch, and a full bathroom with bathtub and shower. You can use our Adirondack chairs to spend time outside or stay in and watch your streaming apps on the Roku TV. There isn't a stove or oven in the Loft but there is a microwave, coffee maker, hot water kettle, toaster, air fryer and electric skillet for simple food preparation, and a grill in the garage you can use upon request.  There are also many great restaurants in Logan just a few minutes away.

Foggy Mountain Loft is on a residential street near town with free on-street parking. If you're towing a trailer, we'll try to save the spaces in front of the house for you with prior arrangement or you can use our driveway. You'll have a private entrance to the Loft at the end of the driveway with access through a digital keypad deadbolt lock.

We're available during your stay for assistance or to answer questions but you'll have as much privacy as you're looking for.

There are many places to eat in Logan and a lot of things to do:

Chief Logan State Park: 5.6 miles
Chief Logan Recreation Center: 8.2 miles
Dunks Body Shop (Gym): 12.5 miles
H & M Bearwallow Trail connector: 1 mile
H & M Bearwallow Trailhead: 4.1 miles
H & M Rockhouse Trailhead: 13.8 miles
H & M Buffalo Mountain Trailhead: 28 miles
H & M Devil Anse Trailhead: 34.6 miles

Gas station (which usually has the cheapest gas in Logan) is just about a mile away (just past the coffee house and bakery...)!

On street parking is easy to find near Foggy Mountain Loft. If you're raveling with a trailer you'll be able to find a spot within a couple blocks of the Loft. With prior arrangement, guests traveling with a trailer can have the parking spaces in front of  our house saved by us until their arrival or can park in the driveway (pulling truck into carport, there's room for a trailer with one ATV).

This is a 2nd floor loft with a narrow staircase, so you'll need to keep an eye on small children and keep in mind your own ability to climb stairs.","1. No parties or events may be held at the Loft or on the property. 
2. No overnight guests other than those registered and approved when making the reservation online. If you are expecting visitors for a short period of time during your stay, please let your hosts know.
3. No pets are permitted without prior permission and with an additional pet charge of $25 per pet (maximum one large dog or two small dogs). Sorry, no cats are permitted ever. We have four (friendly) dogs so we will need to coordinate yard usage to avoid any possible problems. Please clean up after your pet! Pets may not be left unattended for more than 2 hours and must be in a kennel/travel carrier. If you need assistance finding a dog-sitter please contact your hosts ahead of time.
4. Trash cans and bags are provided in the Loft (under the sink in the kitchen and bathroom). If the cans get full during your stay, please take the trash out and put in one of the trash cans in, or by, the driveway. No need to take out the trash at the end of your stay.
5. No hair dying or coloring is permitted in the Loft.
6. We do not have child safety features; children are welcome if you accept liability and are comfortable knowing we have no child proofing along with many stairs.
7. Minors under the age of 18 must be accompanied, in person AT ALL TIMES, by an adult over 21. You must be 21 to book a reservation at the Loft.
8. The antler hooks by the door will not hold heavy loads. Please only hang light jackets and clothing on them.
9. Please clean your boots/shoes as well as you can before entering the building and use the boot tray upstairs by the door for your boots and shoes.
10. Please do not block neighbor’s driveways, including the apartment’s next door. We will do what we can to help you with parking (including our driveway and street parking in front of our house). Please let us know if you’re traveling with a trailer so we can help you plan for parking.
11. If you would like to sit outside, you are welcome to use the camp chairs at the bottom of the stairs. If it is raining or too sunny, feel free to sit under the carport by the house. If we are parked there, just send us a message during daytime hours (9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) and we’ll move our car: we want you to enjoy your stay! You can also sit in the backyard but be aware that our dogs will occasionally need to be let out. If you are using the yard and/or grill, we will check with you before letting out the dogs. When sitting outside after 9 p.m. please try to keep the noise down so as not to disturb the residents and neighbors.
12. Do not go out on the roof. While it looks like a great place to hang out, it’s not safe for people and walking on the shingles are likely to cause damage.
13. Without exception, no smoking, vaping or marijuana usage inside the Loft. Please don’t think it can be covered up, it cannot. We have to extensively clean to remove the contaminant before other guests can arrive. Neutralizing this contaminant inside requires a $100 minimum service fee. Feel free to step outside in the back yard and quietly enjoy a tobacco smoke or vape; you'll just need to police your butts.
14. Before you leave, please wash any dishes that you used. Clean dishes can be left in the drainer to dry and we’ll put them away.
15. No need to strip the bed or pile up used towels and washcloths upon departure but during your stay, please hang wet towels and washcloths on the towel racks, shower curtain rod or side of the bathtub.
16. Please lock the door at the bottom of the steps whenever you leave the premises, including your departure.","We're available during your stay for assistance or to answer questions but you'll have as much privacy as you're looking for.","en","English","Foggy Mountain Loft near Hatfield & McCoy Trails","There are many places to eat in Logan and a lot of things to do:

The space is a large art/photography studio that has been transformed into an inviting living space. You’ll love the peace and quiet after a day on the trails. 

Buy your official Hatfield - McCoyTrail Permit on site. Trail maps provided with permit purchase. 

(Let Peggie know you want to purchase Trail Passes when you book the studio.)

A clean stream runs beside the studio; nestled between mountains on all sides. Be disturbed by nothing but the sights and sounds of nature. 

 You’ll experience the peace and tranquility of rural Southern West Virginia, while still being minutes away from the main attractions you are here to enjoy.

You might not see another person during your stay, but deer and other wildlife are plentiful.",,"Get away from everything when you stay at Peggie’s Studio Retreat. The studio is away from dusty, noisy, congested campgrounds and outside city limits.

A clean stream runs beside the studio; nestled between mountains on all sides. Be disturbed by nothing but the sights and sounds of nature. 

 You’ll experience the peace and tranquility of rural Southern West Virginia, while still being minutes away from the main attractions you are here to enjoy.

Not a Trail Rider, just looking for a peaceful getaway? We’ve got you covered.","Peggie’s Studio Retreat is nestled in a secluded hollow just minutes from the Bearwallow Trailhead of the Hatfields & McCoys’ Trail System. 

The space is a large art/photography studio that has been transformed into an inviting living space. You’ll love the peace and quiet after a day on the trails. 

Buy your official Hatfield - McCoyTrail Permit on site. Trail maps provided with permit purchase. 

(Let Peggie know you want to purchase Trail Passes when you book the studio.)","Park on a gravel parking lot, large enough for your truck and trailer.

We have 3 separate bedrooms.  In 2 of the bedrooms there are queen size bed.   In the other bedroom we have 2 full size beds.  We have 1 bathroom with a shower and a laundry area  a washer and dryer

There's a Tudor's Biscuit World Restaurant on site.  Other restaurants nearby.  Also Chief Logan state park is just a couple of miles down the road.  There is a Carwash close by

Bearwallow is a fun trail. Small but worth a good ride. There is a hill climb on 35, a
Coal mine on 36, a Collapsed coal mine on 86.  83 is a fun,  but more technical trail that has a deep mud pit on it. 
27 has two decent mud holes right in the middle of a wide open area. 
28 is nothing but mud.

Nice fire pit with benches.  Please bring your own firewood.  Also have a corn  hole game on-site.

We do not permit any type of partying or loud music.


*We are also just a couple of of miles from chief Logan State Park.  In the month of December they have “Christmas in the Park” light display.  Best in the state!

Close enough to town (1.2 miles) that you can ride your ATV to the Hatfield McCoy trail, restaurants, grocery stores and gas stations yet far enough away that you don't hear the train come through town. The Devil Anse trail head is the closest trail, however it connects to the Buffalo Mountain and Rock House trail that you can ride all the way to the town of Gilbert. The 1 acre flat elevated lot provides privacy from neighbors and enough parking for all your trucks, trailers and ATV's. A power washer is provided to wash your ATV for no charge.

The entire house and yard are accessible to guests.

You can reach me anytime during your stay if you need anything.

Located in historic Matewan with direct access to trail 31 of the Devil Anse trail system there's no shortage of things to do. Whether riding your ATV on the famous trail system or visiting the historic sites of the Hatfield McCoy feud our town offers something for everyone.

Matewan is an ATV friendly town so you can ride into town or directly to the trail head. Our lot offers an acre of flat, private and secure parking.

Whether riding your ATV on the famous trail system or visiting the historic sites of the Hatfield McCoy feud our town offers something for everyone.","Our family has been in this holler for over 40 years so we can direct you to the best attractions, restaurants and entertainment in the area. For your safety the property is under video surveillance.","Close enough to town (1.2 miles) that you can ride your ATV to the Hatfield McCoy trail, restaurants, grocery stores and gas stations yet far enough away that you don't hear the train come through town. The Devil Anse trail head is the closest trail, however it connects to the Buffalo Mountain and Rock House trail that you can ride all the way to the town of Gilbert. The 1 acre flat elevated lot provides privacy from neighbors and enough parking for all your trucks, trailers and ATV's. A power washer is provided to wash your ATV for no charge.","My place is good for couples, families (with kids), and big groups.","Matewan is an ATV friendly town so you can ride into town or directly to the trail head.

3 bedrooms - 4 beds

This area of Matewan is known as “Hatfield Bottom”

No need to trailer, ride your SXS everywhere!

Parking notes;  Updated to reflect the new gravel parking area. If you have 3 trailers we recommend 2 of them being under 20' depending on tow vehicle length. If you have multiple longer Rigs or just want more space, there is also public parking for trucks/trailers in town. This would allow for parking longer rigs and just driving your SXS / ORV to the house.","Our home is designed for a maximum of 6 guests.
