The cantilever deck overlooks the river which is about 30 steps away.  You can fish off of the dock or tie your boat up to it. Bring your kayaks or canoes and put them in right in front of the house! Beautiful fire pit with seating for 6, overlooking the river and scenic mountains!

Please take note that bedroom 1 (queen room) and bedroom 3 (twin w/trundle bed) share a closet. 

All bedrooms have a  24” smart TV and WIFI. 

The house is a 30 minute scenic drive along the historic Midland Trail to New River Gorge National Park and Preserve. You’ll pass a couple of waterfalls along the way so make a day of it! Fayetteville, voted “coolest small town”, is right along the route to New River Gorge and has many locally owned restaurants and breweries. It's also home of several adventure companies who offer hiking, biking, white water rafting, repelling, ATV riding, horseback riding & so much more! 

Charleston, the state’s capital, is about 40 minutes drive west.  

Summerville Lake State Park is roughly 36 miles from the cottage and offers a nice beach, boat rental, lighthouse and more. 

We hope you love WV and our little piece of Heaven on the river, as much as we do!

We will give you all the space you need but we are only a few streets away if you have any questions or need assistance with something.

Close knit neighborhood. Owners live on another street in the same community. Friendly family atmosphere but being right on the river gives you privacy if you want it.

This studio efficiency apartment has just been newly remodeled.  Roughly 400 square feet.  There is a wet bar with sink, microwave, small refrigerator, and coffee maker compatible with K cups.  King size bed, large walk in shower, a sofa, and a desk for any business needs.

Guest have access to the entire apartment.  If you continue walking down the common hallway of the building there is a stairway that leads to a second entrance directly onto Main Street (best way to access the restaurants downtown).

I will not be personally meeting guests for check in but if guests should need anything at all they can call, text, or email at anytime, day or night, and I will assist in anyway I can.

With this unit being located right in the center of downtown, you're within a short walking distance of all restaurants and businesses located on Main Street.  There are 4 restaurants/bars, a moonshine distillery, and many other businesses to visit while in town.

Whitesburg is a small little town and there aren't any local cab companies to get around but you shouldn't have a problem finding anything on your own.  If you have any questions on how to get somewhere or things to do just send me a text and I'll help you out.

Parking for this unit is behind the building located on Hayes Street.  There are 4 spots directly behind the building and then 6 Long parking spots to the side of the building with ""permit parking only"" signs.  You are welcome to park in any of those spaces that are available.  You can also park in the parking lot just down the hill between Whitaker Bank and Community Trust Bank and also in any of the parallel parking spaces located on Main Street.  The double glass entry doors to the building are located right next to the parking lot on Hayes Street and you'll see the ""Apartments on Main"" logo on the entry door.","Absolutely No Smoking

Sit on the porch and soak up those mountain views. Relax in the hot tub and count the stars. Reconnect with your spouse as you unplug from the hustle and bustle. Rest, laugh, enjoy! 

The cabin is located on a working family farm. You can purchase beef, pork, and chicken to cook while you’re here or bring a cooler and take some home.

Take a break from life. Get away. Come relax in solitude or with your spouse. Reconnect with nature. Breathe in that fresh air. Observe wildlife and get a taste of life on the farm.

The cabin completely private, but if you’d like to visit with family or friends there is another cabin located on the farm too. Check out our other listing for Valley View Cabin. You cannot see the other cabin, but it is located a couple hundred yards away.

You will have the entire cabin to yourself. You can go for a walk, enjoy the hot tub, grill out, roast marshmallows over the fire pit, or just rock on the front porch and take it easy.

We are available by phone (call or text) if you need anything.  We can offer suggestions of things to do while here (folder of information in the cabin). If we’re around we’d be happy to show you around the farm.

We are about a mile off of Hwy 16 (Back of the Dragon). About 10 miles from Hungry Mother State Park (hiking, fishing, beach swimming area...). We’re 25 minutes from Marion where there is an adorable Main Street with shops and eateries.  We are about 45 minutes from Abingdon (Barter Theatre, antique shopping, dining, winery...).

We are not near any public transportation.

We are about 25 minutes away from town. So, you may want to plan to stop at the grocery store on your way in. There are plenty of great restaurants in Marion. (We have a list of restaurants and activities to do while here.) FYI: Many of the Marion shops/restaurants are CLOSED on Mondays!

On our farm we raise and sell pastured beef, chicken, and pork. If you plan to cook while you are here let us know and you can order some homegrown meat ahead of time and we will have it waiting in your fridge. (Sausage or bacon for breakfast, steaks, hamburger, chicken breast, pork chops...) Bring a cooler so you can take some beef, chicken, and pork back home with you. You can see what's available and order directly through our website www.oldrichvalleyfarm dot com.","Hot tubs are very expensive.  We ask that you read and follow all rules of the hot tub (listed in the cabin) to make sure it doesn’t get damaged.  

This is a working farm. We ask that you are very careful around the animals and stay off of all farm equipment.","We are available by phone (call or text) if you need anything.

Restaurant on site and also very close to a car wash.  If you need a place to stay for the holidays while visiting family, this is the place for you!

We have 3 separate bedrooms.  In 2 of the bedrooms there are queen size bed.   In the other bedroom we have 2 full size beds.  We have 1 bathroom with a shower and a laundry area  a washer and dryer

There's a Tudor's Biscuit World Restaurant on site.  Other restaurants nearby.  Also Chief Logan state park is just a couple of miles down the road.  There is a Carwash close by

Bearwallow is a fun trail. Small but worth a good ride. There is a hill climb on 35, a
Coal mine on 36, a Collapsed coal mine on 86.  83 is a fun,  but more technical trail that has a deep mud pit on it. 
27 has two decent mud holes right in the middle of a wide open area. 
28 is nothing but mud.

Nice fire pit with benches.  Please bring your own firewood.  Also have a corn  hole game on-site.

We do not permit any type of partying or loud music.


*We are also just a couple of of miles from chief Logan State Park.  In the month of December they have “Christmas in the Park” light display.  Best in the state!

We do not permit any type of partying or loud music.


*We are also just a couple of of miles from chief Logan State Park.  In the month of December they have “Christmas in the Park” light display.  Best in the state!

Restaurant on site and also very close to a car wash.  If you need a place to stay for the holidays while visiting family, this is the place for you!","Bearwallow is a fun trail. Small but worth a good ride. There is a hill climb on 35, a
Coal mine on 36, a Collapsed coal mine on 86.  83 is a fun,  but more technical trail that has a deep mud pit on it. 
27 has two decent mud holes right in the middle of a wide open area. 
28 is nothing but mud.","41","77","79","167","665",,,,"pdp_m2_5_bathroom","","Bathroom","33","34","40","85","86",,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_bedroom_laundry","","Bedroom and laundry","1",,,,,"pdp_m2_5_entertainment","","Entertainment","5","30","139",,,,,"pdp_m2_5_heating_cooling","","Heating and cooling","35",,,,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_home_safety","","Home safety","4",,,,,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_internet_office","","Internet and office","8","89","90","91","93","94","95","96","236","251",,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_kitchen_dining","","Kitchen and dining","57","132",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_location","","Location features","99","101","219","280",,,"pdp_m2_5_outdoor","","Outdoor","9","23",,,,,,"pdp_m2_5_parking_facilities","","Parking and facilities","104",,,,"pdp_m2_5_services","","Services","36",,,,"pdp_unavailable","","Not included",,,,,,"false","4.95","WV","0","https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/51144235"
