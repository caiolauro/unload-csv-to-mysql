This is a vacation rental agreement under the North Carolina Vacation Rental Act.  The rights and obligations of the parties to this agreement are defined by law and include unique provisions permitting the disbursement of rent prior to tenancy and expedited eviction of tenants.  Your signature on this agreement, or payment of money, or taking possession of the property after receipt of this agreement, is evidence of your acceptance of the agreement and your intent to use this property for a vacation rental.  Rentals exceeding 90 days do not fall under the NC vacation rental management act and are not subject to the same protections adhered to by the NC Vacation Rental Management Act.

Maximum occupancy must be strictly adhered to.  Occupancy count includes children.  Exceeding the occupancy limit set for your unit is ground for immediate eviction.  No exceptions and no refunds!

Accidental Damage Protector & Security Deposits:  The Accidental Damage Protection Plan is included in the advertised total amount and indemnifies you and your family up to $1500 for any accidental damage during your stay. All accidental damage must be reported to our office in writing by the end of renter’s stay in order for Damage Protector to apply.  Damage Protector is a surety contract and is not insurance.  RRR is not an insurer, insurance agent or underwriter.  The Accidental Damage Protection is non refundable.  Damage Protector does NOT cover intentional damage, excessive cleaning, theft, Acts of God, gross negligence, pet damage, utilities, rent, pay for view cable charges, additional costs incurred during stay per renter’s request, or loss of use.  Any intentional property damage or items listed above will be billed to the renter and may be charged to renter’s account or credit card on file without renter’s consent if RRR is unable to contact renter to request authorization.  

A security deposit can be elected in lieu of Accidental Damage Protection.  The cost ranges from $200 to $800 depending on the rental unit.  It is fully refundable by mail within 30 days of departure providing no damages have been made to the unit and the unit has been left tidy (according to our check out procedures) or (less any allowable deductions).  The security deposit can be paid in advance by personal check, money order, certified funds or credit card. Security deposits paid upon arrival must be paid by cash or credit card only. 

A few homes may require an additional security deposit beyond what is required above in this rental agreement.  The renter agrees to reimburse the homeowner for any damages to the property caused by renter that are in excess of, or not covered by Damage Protector or the security deposit.  Such damages shall include reasonable attorney fees and court costs.  The provisions of Article 5, Chapter 42A of the North Carolina General Statutes (Landlord and tenant Duties) are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth.

The renter fully understands that RRR is a rental agency engaging in the rental of private property of others.  RRR reserves the right to refuse service to anyone RRR feels will not be responsible for the property he/she is renting. RRR does not rent to anyone under the age of 21.  Each rental unit requires a person 21 or older to rent and sign the rental contract.  This person must be present at check-in and for duration of rental.  Renter understands that RRR has the right to terminate this agreement, re-enter the unit, or take necessary measures to remove the renter from the premises in the event renter and guests violates the conditions of this agreement.  RRR is not responsible for the loss or theft of clothing, money, jewelry, etc. and is not be held liable for any accidents or injury of any nature.  RRR reserves the right to move any reservation that might come about due to unforeseen circumstances (house sold, out of rental program, owner’s use, act of God, etc.)  Under no circumstances is the obligation of RRR more than that of refunding the renter’s deposit. Rates are subject to all applicable taxes.  Rates are subject to change with notice.

Accommodations: All of our vacation properties are individually owned and reflect each owner’s taste.  Rearranging of furniture is not permitted. If you have specific standards or requirements for your vacation residence we advise personal inspection of the property prior to making reservations. Burning wood in any gas fireplace is prohibited and subject to forfeiture of security deposit.  Grilling is not permitted on any porches, decks or walkways.  All units are provided with enough garbage bags, paper towels, dishwashing detergent, bath soap, and toilet paper to get you started.  If you need more of these items, you can purchase them at Food Lion located on Tynecastle Hwy or other local grocery stores.  Firewood is NOT provided.  Propane/grill accessories are NOT provided. A one-time linen fee is charged on all units.  Linens are provided with initial set-up.  Additional linens/towels are not provided.  Towels for pools and/or hot tubs are not provided. There is a fee for extras and exchanges.

Renter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless RRR and the owner from and against any liability for personal injury or property damage sustained by any person (including renter’s guests) as a result of any cause, unless caused by the negligent or willful act of RRR or the owner, or the failure of the RRR or the owner to comply with the Vacation Rental Act.  Renter agrees that RRR, the owner or their respective representatives may enter the premises during reasonable hours to inspect the premises, to make such repairs, alterations or improvements thereto as RRR or owner may deem appropriate, or to show the premises to perspective purchasers or renters.

RRR does not guarantee any weather, road or ski conditions and there will be no refund as a result of either.  Transportation is the sole responsibility of the renter.  Snow tires, chains or 4-wheel drive is mandatory during adverse weather as stated by Sugar Mountain law.

There will be no refund for weather related issues.  This includes but is not limited to lack of snow or inclement weather preventing the renters’ arrival.  We strongly recommend accepting the travel insurance to assist with obtaining refunds for these situations. No refunds are made for early departures or no shows.

Travel Insurance: We offer travel insurance through Red Sky Travel Insurance.  This provides coverage should you need to cancel or interrupt your trip as well as primary medical coverage, coverage for lack to snow and much more.  Please read your “Description of Coverage” for details.  If no computer access, please ask us to send you a copy of the Insurance Policy. Insurance premiums are non-refundable.

Check-in: Check in starts at 4:00 pm. RRR does not guarantee check-in time. Check in at our office.  No early check-ins are guaranteed.  Renters are not permitted to enter the unit without first coming to the office and checking in.  No entry is allowed until units are cleaned and inspected.

This is a vacation rental agreement under the North Carolina Vacation Rental Act.  The rights and obligations of the parties to this agreement are defined by law and include unique provisions permitting the disbursement of rent prior to tenancy and expedited eviction of tenants.  Your signature on this agreement, or payment of money, or taking possession of the property after receipt of this agreement, is evidence of your acceptance of the agreement and your intent to use this property for a vacation rental.  Rentals exceeding 90 days do not fall under the NC vacation rental management act and are not subject to the same protections adhered to by the NC Vacation Rental Management Act.

Maximum occupancy must be strictly adhered to.  Occupancy count includes children.  Exceeding the occupancy limit set for your unit is ground for immediate eviction.  No exceptions and no refunds!

Accidental Damage Protector & Security Deposits:  The Accidental Damage Protection Plan is included in the advertised total amount and indemnifies you and your family up to $1500 for any accidental damage during your stay. All accidental damage must be reported to our office in writing by the end of renter’s stay in order for Damage Protector to apply.  Damage Protector is a surety contract and is not insurance.  RRR is not an insurer, insurance agent or underwriter.  The Accidental Damage Protection is non refundable.  Damage Protector does NOT cover intentional damage, excessive cleaning, theft, Acts of God, gross negligence, pet damage, utilities, rent, pay for view cable charges, additional costs incurred during stay per renter’s request, or loss of use.  Any intentional property damage or items listed above will be billed to the renter and may be charged to renter’s account or credit card on file without renter’s consent if RRR is unable to contact renter to request authorization.  

A security deposit can be elected in lieu of Accidental Damage Protection.  The cost ranges from $200 to $800 depending on the rental unit.  It is fully refundable by mail within 30 days of departure providing no damages have been made to the unit and the unit has been left tidy (according to our check out procedures) or (less any allowable deductions).  The security deposit can be paid in advance by personal check, money order, certified funds or credit card. Security deposits paid upon arrival must be paid by cash or credit card only. 

A few homes may require an additional security deposit beyond what is required above in this rental agreement.

Such damages shall include reasonable attorney fees and court costs.

       The Busted ATV Resort in beautiful Bramwell, West Virginia, is the place to stay! Less than a mile ride from Hatfield McCoy trail head leading into over three hundred miles of trails. We are about 5 miles from Virginia Spearhead trails. Pinnacle Rock State park look out deck is just one mile from out front door.

Welcome to the McCoy Lodge.  The fully furnished lodge gives you space and privacy. Located at the top of Busted ATV Resort drive makes you king of the hill. Surrounded by the woods and located just six hundred feet from the peak of Mt. Me. There is a coin operated ATV pressure wash and washer and dryer.


This season has been filled with some awesome good times with new and old friends attending. For those of you that Ride Dirty, Sleep Clean  - thank you!  With your continued support My great friend Rob and I will continue to build Busted A in way that's perfect for all our needs. God bless!

Room #8 - The Colonel May Room (Shared Bathroom)

The Colonel May room is dedicated to the youngest son of Andrew Jackson and Nelle May. Andrew named his son “Colonel” in hopes to pass along some of the luster and reputation of his own name. This room is fit for a Colonel and styled for one too. With all the furnishings being dark, rich mahogany, and walnut. A favorite talking piece of this room is the beautiful stone capped foot boards. And of course, the guests who stay in this room are in love with the upper porch located just a few steps outside the room door, perfect for enjoying and relaxing.","HOUSE RULES & OCCUPANCY:

We are pet friendly with lots of room for you four-legged love ones to explore.

Water:  We are in a beautiful, rural location with well water; it has a sulphur smell to it.  Although, completely safe to drink and bathe in it has a strong smell many people are not accustomed to this so I like to let guests know upfront.  I leave a gallon of water in the cabin along with the breakfast basket but I always suggest guests bring plenty of water to cook with.

Wi-Fi: As mentioned above, this is a rural location which is great to decompress and find peace and quiet but high speed internet isn’t available in this area. We provide satellite internet, so guests can use Wi-Fi texting and calling (dependent on your cell provider- cell phone service is very limited), check emails and surf the web but streaming Netflix and downloading music unfortunately don’t work.  We have the highest amount of gigabytes available with HughesNet Satellite but once the data caps are reached(which is easy to do if streaming is tried and continues to buffer) the internet eventually stops.  We ask you to please be conscientious with the internet usage so all our guests are able to use it throughout their stay with us.

This place is so special and we want our guests to love it as much as we do so if there is anything we can do throughout your stay we are happy to help.

We are in a rural location; cell phone service is limited but we do have Hughesnet Satellite wi-fi, it doesn't stream video but allows for surfing the web, answering emails, wi-fi texting and calling(depending on you cell phone carrier plan).

As like many people in rural America we are on a well water system so the water has Sulphur, which is completely safe to drink and bath in but does have a Sulphur smell and is an acquired taste.  We supply a gallon of water but suggest our guests bring extra water for drinking due to the taste.","PLEASE HONOR 10AM CHECK-OUT

That was the deciding decision for hosting the airbnb with brothers - Jamie and Troy with help from everyone else.

I am a retired art teacher from Taylor County WV and Lexington Senior High NC. I live in Thomasville NC with my husband who is also from McDowell County WV.  Besides art, I sew and have an online etsy shop.  My brother Troy, has a house-painting business and lives near Bluefield Va.  Our sister Ann, retired from teaching music and her husband have lived in many areas; they are now retired living in White Sulphur Springs WV.

Our aim is to ensure that you have an enjoyable time and as comfortable a stay as you possibly can. We have found it helps both us and our guests when we thoroughly communicate our expectations and house rules. I know, I know, rules are boring…but these rules ensure we can provide future guests with a great experience as well. 

Parking is free and conveniently available in the driveway to the right of the house. It will accommodate 2-3 cars easily. This driveway leads to a garage behind the house that we use for projects. We try to limit our use of the garage during guest stays, but we will let you know in advance if we need to get in and out of the driveway. However, this is the exception rather than the norm, so please use the driveway freely.  

We have made the decision to open up the basement in order for our guests to have the convenience of using the washer/dryer. Please understand that this is still a rough unfinished space. We are working on some remodeling projects to make it a nicer area for laundry. However, we ask that guests stay out of the basement unless they have specific need of the space, for laundering or other approved use by the hosts. It is also preferred that guests keep the accordion door at the top of the steps closed and use the front door as much as possible. The side exterior door is a snug fit and you may find it difficult to open and close fully without extra effort, please insure it’s securely closed when you leave the property and at night if you have used it during your stay. 
 
No Parties or Events. We do allow daytime visitors, but ask that you stay within a reasonable number of people for the space. Otherwise, only the number of adults listed in the reservation are to be at the house. If you have more overnight guests than what are registered the booking guest will receive a reservation change with additional charges of $50 per person, per night (If you register them the cost is only $25 per guest per night). If we discover that the number of overnight guests exceeds the 6-adult maximum we will contact you to resolve the issue as promptly as possible. Satisfactory resolution is at our discretion. We do use a security system with exterior cameras to verify the number of overnight guests and if animals are present in the house. 
 
Dogs are allowed, based on our approval of size/breed. It is assumed that dogs are housebroken. There is a pet fee, and dogs must be paid for and approved prior to guest arrival. We prefer the dog(s) to be crated any time they are left at the house alone. NO CATS OR OTHER PETS ALLOWED. One of your hosts has a history of severe allergic reactions to cats, therefore if any pets (other than approved dogs) are discovered in the house we reserve the right to evict immediately without a refund. 
 
No Smoking Allowed. Any evidence of smoking in the house will result in a $200 fee. Smoking in outdoor areas is okay as long as butts are discarded properly. 
 
If your shoes are wet or dirty, please remove them before entering. You can leave them on the porch or use the boot tray by the door. This house is located in a residential neighborhood and although the houses are generously spaced, we ask that you be considerate of our neighbors with your noise level. Please follow any instructions, label notes or manuals we have left in order to ensure longevity of furnishings, appliances and other items. Read through the checkout procedures to familiarize yourself with what we expect of our guests. 

Checkout time is 11AM. If you find that you need a late check-out, please know that we will try to accommodate requests if there is not a same day check-in. There is a late check out fee of $10/hour, when needed and if available. 

Check under beds for misplaced belongings, check outlets for chargers that belong to you and remember to log out of any accounts you used on the Xbox, Living Room TV streaming service or the upstairs Roku. 

Close all windows securely. Turn off all the lights, and allow the thermostat to return to its regular schedule. 

Please remove sheets and pillowcases off of any bed used and leave the linens by the door of the bedroom, please leave mattress pads on the bed and place comforter and all pillows back on the bed. Place all used towels in the bath tub. 

Please wash any used dishes, if you need to leave any in the drying rack, we will gladly put them away. 

When you leave through the front door, lock both exterior doors from the inside and leave the keys on the table. 

Please take a moment to write a note in our guest book. If you enjoyed your stay, please leave us a review. If there were any problems, or you have any suggestions, send us a message through Airbnb or email us directly and let us know how we can improve.

Mountain views surround this 3 bedroom home located in Narrows, Va, a community that brims with small town charm. Less than 30 miles to Virginia Tech, Concord College, or Radford University. Winterplace, Mountain Lake and Kairos Wilderness are just a short drive away too. Giles Co. is home to 37 miles of the New River, with endless hiking including the Appalachian Trail, and the must see Cascade Falls.

Enter our open concept home and enjoy the streaming service of your choice on the 50” tv while making a meal for your friends or family in the open kitchen. First two bedrooms are on the main floor. One has a full size bed, and the second has a queen size bedroom suit with a dresser and chest of drawers. Between the bedrooms and through an easily gliding barn door find the bathroom that is just the right size for “one at a time” use with a vanity and tub/shower combo. In other words, it’s small, but adequate to serve our guests. Although, you may find scheduling showers helpful if you are at the upper end of our guest limit with 5 or 6 adults. Just upstairs you will find a beautiful sitting room with an elevated view of the mountains that includes a desk/office space for the business traveler. Then further on through another door is the final bedroom with a spacious king bed that can easily be separated into two twin beds by the hosts upon request at booking. This space enjoys its own A/C and Heating Unit that can be controlled separately from the lower levels. Enjoy watching television on the 42” tv in this bedroom equipped with a Roku.

Your hosts live just ten minutes away and are readily available to help or answer questions you may have. We have a personal garage on this property so you will likely see us come in or out but our access to the house will be limited to attending to the needs of our guests. You are welcome to drop in the garage and say hi if we are there as we will surely be working on our latest project. We will do our best to respect the privacy of our guests in our coming and going. You can call or text our phone during your stay if needed or contact us through the app or email.

We are in a neighborhood with neighbors in close proximity to the house. Please respect their privacy and know that yours will be respected in return. We have always found our neighbors to be helpful and kind.

Convenient to 460, less than a mile from the light in Narrows.

Before and during your stay you can  check out “Christy’s” guidebook here in the airBNB app for some nearby highlights. During your stay there are pamphlets for local attractions in the drawer under the microwave.
There is a picnic basket provided for your use during your stay…mainly because we are just romantics at heart. 
Hangers are available for your use in every closet. 
The iron and ironing board are located in the left side bedroom closet; along with extra pillows. In the right side bedroom, the labeled dresser drawers have the hair dryer and extra blankets. In the same bedroom, but in the chest of drawers you will find all provided guest towels, wash clothes and as a bonus complimentary pairs of slippers for you to use during your stay and to take home when you leave.  
There is an Xbox connected to the living room television but you will need to have your own Microsoft account or games of your own to use it. There is high speed internet service which you will use to view shows and movies via the provided streaming service on the Living Room TV and a Roku upstairs. HBO Max will be logged in for you upon arrival.
The coffee table lifts to table height for use as extra dining space. Please use two hands to lift both sides evenly and simultaneously. You shouldn’t have to force the lift or on closure; it should glide easily. 
Please protect the living room furniture with coasters, tablecloth, and placemats as necessary.
Please see our house manual from more detailed instructions and listings of what we offer throughout the house.","House Rules 
 
Our aim is to ensure that you have an enjoyable time and as comfortable a stay as you possibly can. We have found it helps both us and our guests when we thoroughly communicate our expectations and house rules. I know, I know, rules are boring…but these rules ensure we can provide future guests with a great experience as well. 

Parking is free and conveniently available in the driveway to the right of the house. It will accommodate 2-3 cars easily. This driveway leads to a garage behind the house that we use for projects. We try to limit our use of the garage during guest stays, but we will let you know in advance if we need to get in and out of the driveway. However, this is the exception rather than the norm, so please use the driveway freely.  

We have made the decision to open up the basement in order for our guests to have the convenience of using the washer/dryer. Please understand that this is still a rough unfinished space. We are working on some remodeling projects to make it a nicer area for laundry. However, we ask that guests stay out of the basement unless they have specific need of the space, for laundering or other approved use by the hosts. It is also preferred that guests keep the accordion door at the top of the steps closed and use the front door as much as possible. The side exterior door is a snug fit and you may find it difficult to open and close fully without extra effort, please insure it’s securely closed when you leave the property and at night if you have used it during your stay. 
 
No Parties or Events. We do allow daytime visitors, but ask that you stay within a reasonable number of people for the space. Otherwise, only the number of adults listed in the reservation are to be at the house. If you have more overnight guests than what are registered the booking guest will receive a reservation change with additional charges of $50 per person, per night (If you register them the cost is only $25 per guest per night). If we discover that the number of overnight guests exceeds the 6-adult maximum we will contact you to resolve the issue as promptly as possible. Satisfactory resolution is at our discretion. We do use a security system with exterior cameras to verify the number of overnight guests and if animals are present in the house. 
 
Dogs are allowed, based on our approval of size/breed. It is assumed that dogs are housebroken. There is a pet fee, and dogs must be paid for and approved prior to guest arrival. We prefer the dog(s) to be crated any time they are left at the house alone. NO CATS OR OTHER PETS ALLOWED. One of your hosts has a history of severe allergic reactions to cats, therefore if any pets (other than approved dogs) are discovered in the house we reserve the right to evict immediately without a refund. 
 
No Smoking Allowed. Any evidence of smoking in the house will result in a $200 fee. Smoking in outdoor areas is okay as long as butts are discarded properly. 
 
If your shoes are wet or dirty, please remove them before entering. You can leave them on the porch or use the boot tray by the door. This house is located in a residential neighborhood and although the houses are generously spaced, we ask that you be considerate of our neighbors with your noise level. Please follow any instructions, label notes or manuals we have left in order to ensure longevity of furnishings, appliances and other items. Read through the checkout procedures to familiarize yourself with what we expect of our guests. 

Checkout time is 11AM. If you find that you need a late check-out, please know that we will try to accommodate requests if there is not a same day check-in. There is a late check out fee of $10/hour, when needed and if available. 

Check under beds for misplaced belongings, check outlets for chargers that belong to you and remember to log out of any accounts you used on the Xbox, Living Room TV streaming service or the upstairs Roku. 

Close all windows securely. Turn off all the lights, and allow the thermostat to return to its regular schedule. 

Please remove sheets and pillowcases off of any bed used and leave the linens by the door of the bedroom, please leave mattress pads on the bed and place comforter and all pillows back on the bed. Place all used towels in the bath tub. 

Please wash any used dishes, if you need to leave any in the drying rack, we will gladly put them away. 

When you leave through the front door, lock both exterior doors from the inside and leave the keys on the table. 

Please take a moment to write a note in our guest book. If you enjoyed your stay, please leave us a review. If there were any problems, or you have any suggestions, send us a message through Airbnb or email us directly and let us know how we can improve. 

Thanks, 
David & Christy","Your hosts live just ten minutes away and are readily available to help or answer questions you may have. We have a personal garage on this property so you will likely see us come in or out but our access to the house will be limited to attending to the needs of our guests. You are welcome to drop in the garage and say hi if we are there as we will surely be working on our latest project. We will do our best to respect the privacy of our guests in our coming and going. You can call or text our phone during your stay if needed or contact us through the app or email.","en","English","Almost, Almost Heaven","We are in a neighborhood with neighbors in close proximity to the house. Please respect their privacy and know that yours will be respected in return. We have always found our neighbors to be helpful and kind.","Before and during your stay you can  check out “Christy’s” guidebook here in the airBNB app for some nearby highlights. During your stay there are pamphlets for local attractions in the drawer under the microwave.
There is a picnic basket provided for your use during your stay…mainly because we are just romantics at heart. 
Hangers are available for your use in every closet. 
The iron and ironing board are located in the left side bedroom closet; along with extra pillows. In the right side bedroom, the labeled dresser drawers have the hair dryer and extra blankets. In the same bedroom, but in the chest of drawers you will find all provided guest towels, wash clothes and as a bonus complimentary pairs of slippers for you to use during your stay and to take home when you leave.  
There is an Xbox connected to the living room television but you will need to have your own Microsoft account or games of your own to use it. There is high speed internet service which you will use to view shows and movies via the provided streaming service on the Living Room TV and a Roku upstairs. HBO Max will be logged in for you upon arrival.
The coffee table lifts to table height for use as extra dining space. Please use two hands to lift both sides evenly and simultaneously. You shouldn’t have to force the lift or on closure; it should glide easily. 
Please protect the living room furniture with coasters, tablecloth, and placemats as necessary.
Please see our house manual from more detailed instructions and listings of what we offer throughout the house.","Enter our open concept home and enjoy the streaming service of your choice on the 50” tv while making a meal for your friends or family in the open kitchen. First two bedrooms are on the main floor. One has a full size bed, and the second has a queen size bedroom suit with a dresser and chest of drawers. Between the bedrooms and through an easily gliding barn door find the bathroom that is just the right size for “one at a time” use with a vanity and tub/shower combo. In other words, it’s small, but adequate to serve our guests. Although, you may find scheduling showers helpful if you are at the upper end of our guest limit with 5 or 6 adults. Just upstairs you will find a beautiful sitting room with an elevated view of the mountains that includes a desk/office space for the business traveler. Then further on through another door is the final bedroom with a spacious king bed that can easily be separated into two twin beds by the hosts upon request at booking. This space enjoys its own A/C and Heating Unit that can be controlled separately from the lower levels. Enjoy watching television on the 42” tv in this bedroom equipped with a Roku. 
The unfinished basement holds a washer and dryer and has ample space for sorting laundry.","Forget your worries in this spacious and serene spot minutes from the West Virginia border.

Though I grew up in South Florida, I loved my summers there away from the Florida heat. I hiked in the woods, swam in cold streams, explored waterfalls and fell in love. Being adventurous, I rapelled in the New River Gorge, skiied for the first time at Snowshoe and learned a love of rafting that continues today as I pursue trips on many Western Rivers in New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and Arizona.Life took me out west to Santa Fe, New Mexico where I pursued an art career and eventually a Real Estate career. I feel blessed to have helped my mother find her dream cabins, and to now again get to spend family time in this wonderful place. Many friends and family are still nearby and it is like coming “home” to stay at the cabins on Anam Cara Way.

We hope you will find joy, and peace, and feel that our home is your home when you stay at our sweet cabins.","121 Reviews","Identity verified",,"Danna","false","true","https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/306956733","306956733","true",,,,"2","Joined in November 2019","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/825f8b0d-ea09-410c-8cfd-cd4ab8b01478.jpg?aki_policy=profile_large","100%","within an hour","Danna","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/825f8b0d-ea09-410c-8cfd-cd4ab8b01478.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","3","0","70","Accuracy","4.8","0.962","10","Communication","4.9","0.982","10","Cleanliness","4.8","0.954","10","Location","4.9","0.982","10","Check-in","4.9","0.9720000000000001","10","Value","4.7","0.942","9","4.83","language_country","Entire cabin","entire_home","8","4","9","27","available_amenities","","Amenities",,,,,,,"human","The Whitetail is a conventional-style log cabin, cozy and appealing, with two bedrooms, two baths, living room, dining and kitchen; stone wood-burning fireplace, central A/C-heat.

Feel free to walk around the neighborhood.  Adjacent to the US Post Office just a few minute walk, a small park contains a sign marking the ""Athens Concord Trails"", these include a mixture of on and off campus trails mapped out around the local area.  In town, we have CVS as our chain pharmacy, Dollar General as the local chain store, and Ginos as the chain restaurant.  Moe's is a local restaurant next door to the gas station with great reviews and a full menu of many types of food, and lots of comfort food options.

You may park on the street directly in front of the building.  When you enter the front door, the apartment is directly to the right.

All guests are welcome whether vaccinated or unvaccinated! Since I was fully vaccinated and got COVID anyway, it shows that they will not prevent it. We can just take the distance precautions and be careful and pray that God will watch over us!!!!

I do not accept guests at all who are smokers. Nor do I like to sit up half the night for late arrivals! Nine pm is the definite cutoff for guests to arrive.

Check in time is 4 pm. Note this please. Please plan to be here no later than nine   pm if possible. In the past when I have accepted late arrivals it sometimes runs as late as midnight or after and that is too much to ask of an Airbnb host. I am not a motel that stays open 24/7! And even though I have this stipulation posted right here, I still have people who ask me to accept them late and I simply will not. 

 Check out is 10 am but based on my activities I  may have to ask guests to check out earlier on some days.  Please be considerate.
 
ALSO, the guest rooms are not pet friendly and I do not allow guests to have pets. So many people ask even though I  have that specified on my listing, so don't even ask because I will not accept. I have to think about the cleanliness of all guests in this respect as I am sure some people would not want to stay in rooms where pets had stayed! I do not even allow my own dog in the rental areas, BTW! Nor do I accept young children as my home is not safe for young kids.

I request you remove shoes worn outside when entering the house and have house shoes as bare feet are not safe. Socks are not safe either as they can be slippery on some types of floors, so house shoes are better for traction.

Absolutely no food or drink in the carpeted bedrooms, East and West. There is a common room available for you to eat and drink so please respect my wishes on this. Coffee, tea, bottled water, and snacks are available in the common room with ample space for multiple guests. NO TAKING COFFEE UP TO A BEDROOM! 

Please do not use fragrances either as I have multiple chemical sensitivity and am allergic to odors.  Fragrance free soap, shampoo, etc. is provided. 

Please pick up roll around luggage so the wheels do not soil the floor or carpets.

 Please let me know when you will arrive as I have to check you in in person.

First and foremost, I am a Christian who believes the truth of the Bible and tries to apply it to each and every moment of my life here on earth.  I consider the Bible a road map for my life.  This doesn't mean that I am a perfect individual, but that I am forgiven!  I have been totally blessed by hosting Airbnb guests from around the world and I love the people and this new adventure in my life.  My motto is Scripture:  I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me;  Philippians 4:13

I am a retired business/computer programming teacher.  I like to read,, use the computer, eat out, do things with friends, and do jigsaw and crossword puzzles.  I also enjoy community activities and am an active Ruritan Club member and a member of the Woodlawn United Methodist Church.  I am also in the Carroll County Retired Teachers Association.  I was a member of the local chapter of the Experimental Aircraft Association that my husband co-founded here at Twin County Airport.  The main focus of the organization is to expose children to aviation and give free airplane rides to children ages 8 - 17.  Regrettably, this organization has disbanded after losing its most avid leader.  

I have three listings on this site which are a Walkout basement, East Bedroom and West Bedroom.  I have learned from previous guests that they do not see all three listings when making reservations, thus I am stating that information here.  so you can search for all of them.  Food is allowed in the basement room, but not allowed in the other two bedrooms.  All of them have private bathrooms.  There is TV available for all who want to watch it. The basement room has a flat 55 inch TV with streaming capabilities via Apple TV . The West bedroom has a smart TV so shows can be accessed by that system with the guest sign-in on Netflix, etc.  The East bedroom has access to a 65 inch smart TV in the balcony on which guests using the East room can sign into accounts and stream shows. This is not accessible by other guests in the house.

All guests have access to mini appliances for fixing meals. However, guests are not allowed to use my kitchen.
  
Please park by the three car garage unless you have reserved the basement room.  Parking on the right side of the house garage is reserved for the occupants of the basement room.  Please read the house rules.  No outdoor shoes in the house, please.  And NO TOBACCO USE OF ANY KIND anywhere on the premises, please.  I have found that not everyone reads all the information listed, thus, some of it is restated here. I do have multiple chemical sensitivity allergies to odors so I provide fragrance free toiletries for the guests. I also request that you carry suitcases and not roll around your luggage on my floors or carpets, please. Every effort is made for cleanliness.

Airbnb will not reveal your picture until after your reservation is accepted. I usually only approve those persons who have positive reviews from other hosts which are posted on the Airbnb site for that prospective guest. If you are new to Airbnb, please include an explanation of who you are and your purpose for traveling.

I am in the southwestern part of the state in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains.      I am only about 15 minutes from the Blue Ridge Parkway and 25 miles from Mt. Airy, NC, which is a great tourist town. Hillsville and Galax are approximately 7 miles away. The home is located about three miles from Interstate 77.

Also, located on the property is the downstairs of this unit (also a vacation rental) as well as two additional vacation rentals (The Berry Cabin and Dreamer’s Lodge).

As you drive the 3 miles into town from I 77 you see a beautiful view of the Appalachian mountains. 
The getaway is a country home, offering a big front porch with rocking chairs to unwind from a busy day of exploring.

The house is two levels with one bedroom and one bath on the main level and three bedrooms and the second bath upstairs. There's room to spread out and enjoy space. The home  has gas wall heaters to instantly heat rooms. There’s a temperature controlled floor furnace / window air conditioner for the living areas. There is a box or ceiling fan in all bedrooms. The kitchen is stocked with all your standard cookware to make a delicious meal and a nice size dining room to fit up to eight people. We have coffee, tea, sugar, creamer, and bottles of water in the refrigerator. We also have a basket with breakfast / snack items. The house has a laundry closet in the downstairs bathroom, and of course we provide all your linens and towels. We also have TVs in the bedrooms with DVD players and a drawer full of DVDs as well as games and books. We have a fire pit with wood and chairs to enjoy some s'mores.

All rooms in this property is accessible to guest including laundry and the grounds around the house are available for outdoor quiet pleasures ( yard games, cookout etc)

I don’t live on site, but very close. If I’m not there to welcome you, I’ll check in on you during your stay if possible. I’m available to answer any questions you have by text or call.

Athens has a very nice town park which has just been renovated with all kinds of new equipment for the little ones to play on. There are college level sporting events within walking distance at Concord University. There are four water falls within an hours drive and water fun to be had by all at three different nearby lakes. We always recommend Pipestem State Park because it has so many fun activities. It has horseback riding, zip lining splash, park, lake with paddle boats, canoes, kayaks, and a beach area with inflatable's in the water. It also has 3 golf courses (a regular 18 hole and a 3 par 9 hole course, and putt putt), along with loads of hiking/ biking trails, and even ax throwing.

Although we are in a small town, we are within walking distance to:
Concord University, Dollar General, CVS, Tutor's Biscuit World, Moe's pizza, 1st Community Bank, different denominational churches, Athens town park, and Deli mart gas station. All other conveniences are one exit down on I77 where you'll find: Walmart, groceries, restaurants, and a brewery. We also have two wedding venues just down the road as well. 
Getting around is easier by car but there is public transportation. The  Bluefield Area Transit stops near the CVS within a 5 min. walk from the house. They service Bluefield, Princeton, Athens and Welch.

Athen's elevation of 2,585ft is small compared to the Winterplace ski resort at 3,600 ft. Winterplace has been voted as the most accessible, affordable place to learn to ski or board in the southeast! It has 90 acres of 28 trails, and the largest snow tubing park in West Virginia. Our weekends fill up quickly during skiing season. 
Whether you are on a business trip, visiting family or vacationing, our house location along with it's charm and amenities should be able to comfortably meet your needs while visiting the area.","Check-in is after 3 PM 
Check out by 11 AM
Guest should leave the house how they found it or there could be additional charges.
Please keep noise levels down and be respectful of neighbors.","I don’t live on site, but very close. If I’m not there to welcome you, I’ll check in on you during your stay if possible.

Plenty of open space. Enjoy the mountain air. Close to the new Hatfield McCoy Warrior Trail.  Unload and you won’t have to haul your ATV/UTV again until you head home.  Many outlaw trails nearby. Right off Rt16.  

If you like riding curves on  motorcycles or sports cars we’re only 30 minutes from Back of the Dragon Visitors Center. 15 minutes to Berwind Lake. A great place to get away from it all!!

No access to attached garage.

All guests are welcome whether vaccinated or unvaccinated! Since I was fully vaccinated and got COVID anyway, it shows that they will not prevent it. We can just take the distance precautions and be careful and pray that God will watch over us!!!!

I do not accept guests at all who are smokers. Nor do I like to sit up half the night for late arrivals! Nine pm is the definite cutoff for guests to arrive.

Check in time is 4 pm. Note this please. Please plan to be here no later than nine   pm if possible. In the past when I have accepted late arrivals it sometimes runs as late as midnight or after and that is too much to ask of an Airbnb host. I am not a motel that stays open 24/7! And even though I have this stipulation posted right here, I still have people who ask me to accept them late and I simply will not. 

 Check out is 10 am but based on my activities I  may have to ask guests to check out earlier on some days.  Please be considerate.
 
ALSO, the guest rooms are not pet friendly and I do not allow guests to have pets. So many people ask even though I  have that specified on my listing, so don't even ask because I will not accept. I have to think about the cleanliness of all guests in this respect as I am sure some people would not want to stay in rooms where pets had stayed! I do not even allow my own dog in the rental areas, BTW! Nor do I accept young children as my home is not safe for young kids.

I request you remove shoes worn outside when entering the house and have house shoes as bare feet are not safe. Socks are not safe either as they can be slippery on some types of floors, so house shoes are better for traction.

Absolutely no food or drink in the carpeted bedrooms, East and West. There is a common room available for you to eat and drink so please respect my wishes on this. Coffee, tea, bottled water, and snacks are available in the common room with ample space for multiple guests. NO TAKING COFFEE UP TO A BEDROOM! 

Please do not use fragrances either as I have multiple chemical sensitivity and am allergic to odors.  Fragrance free soap, shampoo, etc. is provided.

First and foremost, I am a Christian who believes the truth of the Bible and tries to apply it to each and every moment of my life here on earth.  I consider the Bible a road map for my life.  This doesn't mean that I am a perfect individual, but that I am forgiven!  I have been totally blessed by hosting Airbnb guests from around the world and I love the people and this new adventure in my life.  My motto is Scripture:  I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me;  Philippians 4:13

I am a retired business/computer programming teacher.  I like to read,, use the computer, eat out, do things with friends, and do jigsaw and crossword puzzles.  I also enjoy community activities and am an active Ruritan Club member and a member of the Woodlawn United Methodist Church.  I am also in the Carroll County Retired Teachers Association.  I was a member of the local chapter of the Experimental Aircraft Association that my husband co-founded here at Twin County Airport.  The main focus of the organization is to expose children to aviation and give free airplane rides to children ages 8 - 17.  Regrettably, this organization has disbanded after losing its most avid leader.  

I have three listings on this site which are a Walkout basement, East Bedroom and West Bedroom.  I have learned from previous guests that they do not see all three listings when making reservations, thus I am stating that information here.  so you can search for all of them.  Food is allowed in the basement room, but not allowed in the other two bedrooms.  All of them have private bathrooms.  There is TV available for all who want to watch it. The basement room has a flat 55 inch TV with streaming capabilities via Apple TV . The West bedroom has a smart TV so shows can be accessed by that system with the guest sign-in on Netflix, etc.  The East bedroom has access to a 65 inch smart TV in the balcony on which guests using the East room can sign into accounts and stream shows. This is not accessible by other guests in the house.

All guests have access to mini appliances for fixing meals. However, guests are not allowed to use my kitchen.
  
Please park by the three car garage unless you have reserved the basement room.  Parking on the right side of the house garage is reserved for the occupants of the basement room.  Please read the house rules.  No outdoor shoes in the house, please.  And NO TOBACCO USE OF ANY KIND anywhere on the premises, please.  I have found that not everyone reads all the information listed, thus, some of it is restated here. I do have multiple chemical sensitivity allergies to odors so I provide fragrance free toiletries for the guests. I also request that you carry suitcases and not roll around your luggage on my floors or carpets, please. Every effort is made for cleanliness.

Airbnb will not reveal your picture until after your reservation is accepted. I usually only approve those persons who have positive reviews from other hosts which are posted on the Airbnb site for that prospective guest. If you are new to Airbnb, please include an explanation of who you are and your purpose for traveling.

I am in the southwestern part of the state in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains.      I am only about 15 minutes from the Blue Ridge Parkway and 25 miles from Mt.

Guests can contact me through email, text or call my phone.

Children play in the road so drive slowly on Quail Rd. Sometimes the neighbor's little dog will come up the driveway. He is a friendly dog.

Trailers enter at the upper, left gravel driveway and exit at the lower driveway.  Stay on the gravel especially with wet weather because the ground is slippery on the hillside. Don't park in front of the house.  You can drive your ATV on the gravel behind the house and unload at the patio.","Please drive very slow on our road because of children in the neighborhood.
Stay off the grass as much as possible. It will become slippery in rainy/snowy conditions.
Bag all trash and take out to the wooden box. 
If you park your SxS behind the house, be careful not to run into the propane tank. 
Quiet hours are between 12pm and 6am.","Guests can contact me through email, text or call my phone.","en","English","Adventure Rentals near Pocahontas HMT Bluewell","Children play in the road so drive slowly on Quail Rd.

Sit on the porch and soak up those mountain views. Relax in the hot tub and count the stars. Reconnect with your spouse as you unplug from the hustle and bustle. Rest, laugh, enjoy! 

The cabin is located on a working family farm. You can purchase beef, pork, and chicken to cook while you’re here or bring a cooler and take some home.

Take a break from life. Get away. Come relax in solitude or with your spouse. Reconnect with nature. Breathe in that fresh air. Observe wildlife and get a taste of life on the farm.

The cabin completely private, but if you’d like to visit with family or friends there is another cabin located on the farm too. Check out our other listing for Valley View Cabin. You cannot see the other cabin, but it is located a couple hundred yards away.

You will have the entire cabin to yourself. You can go for a walk, enjoy the hot tub, grill out, roast marshmallows over the fire pit, or just rock on the front porch and take it easy.

We are available by phone (call or text) if you need anything.  We can offer suggestions of things to do while here (folder of information in the cabin). If we’re around we’d be happy to show you around the farm.

We are about a mile off of Hwy 16 (Back of the Dragon). About 10 miles from Hungry Mother State Park (hiking, fishing, beach swimming area...). We’re 25 minutes from Marion where there is an adorable Main Street with shops and eateries.  We are about 45 minutes from Abingdon (Barter Theatre, antique shopping, dining, winery...).

We are not near any public transportation.

We are about 25 minutes away from town. So, you may want to plan to stop at the grocery store on your way in. There are plenty of great restaurants in Marion. (We have a list of restaurants and activities to do while here.) FYI: Many of the Marion shops/restaurants are CLOSED on Mondays!

On our farm we raise and sell pastured beef, chicken, and pork. If you plan to cook while you are here let us know and you can order some homegrown meat ahead of time and we will have it waiting in your fridge. (Sausage or bacon for breakfast, steaks, hamburger, chicken breast, pork chops...) Bring a cooler so you can take some beef, chicken, and pork back home with you. You can see what's available and order directly through our website www.oldrichvalleyfarm dot com.","Hot tubs are very expensive.  We ask that you read and follow all rules of the hot tub (listed in the cabin) to make sure it doesn’t get damaged.  

This is a working farm. We ask that you are very careful around the animals and stay off of all farm equipment.","We are available by phone (call or text) if you need anything.

As native Appalachians, my husband and I have a deep love for this region and its people and the tradition of hospitality.  We are both artists of sorts--I'm a freelance writer/reporter and he is a rock 'n roll keyboard player and works in the local school system. And we manage a herd of dairy goats, mostly LaMancha breed. All with names and personalities. Our place is about 15-20  minutes off off I-77. We're close to the notable ""Back of the Dragon"" motorcycle routes. And very close to some beautiful backroad bicycle routes. The scenery is beautiful all seasons of the year but especially the fall. We hope you'll visit!

 As for the goats, they are ""the greatest entertainers and the greatest time wasters"" as my dad used to say. He was a vet and built the house as a home and office. So it has a sort of historic/museum feel in certain sections. 

We don't guarantee food as part of our Airbnb listing,  but I love to cook and if I'm cooking, you're welcome to join us if you don't have other plans. 

Last but not least, we  love to know a little about our guests beforehand so PLEASE make sure you fill out the ""Describe Yourself"" questions under the Airbnb profile section to speed along the booking process.

There's a great little biking road about 1/4 mile from my home that lots of bikers love to ride. About 5 miles away is a great mountain bike trail at the Blfd WV city park. For more serious bikers, there's the Burkes Garden trail. 
For hikers, Lincolnshire Park, about 13 miles away in Tazewell, has features so beautiful you will think you're in the The Hobbit's  ""Shire."" 
For other things to do and places to eat, see my Guidebook section of Guest Resources.

The Town of Bluefield, Va. operates Graham Transit. Graham Transit runs three deviated fixed routes throughout the area each day. I am a 5 minute walk from the closest bus route stop.  Bus route schedules are listed on the Town of Bluefield, Va. official website.

Please have the the Airbnb ""describe yourself"" profile questions filled out (type traveler you are, etc) before you request to book. Also, the local (county) occupancy tax is included in the room price.","I ask guests to avoid any scented (fragranced)  body lotions,  colognes, shampoos etc  in the house. Other guests may also be staying here who have allergies and sensitivities. And for housekeeping, it can take multiple washings to remove some scents.  I do offer fragrance-free shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap, or  laundry soap as amenities that you are welcome to use!   GOATS: Please check with me before feeding them or opening gates.

There is truly no other place like Welch, WV. Once a booming coal town, Welch now has a much smaller population. Welch and McDowell County have garnered much attention over the past decade. The New York Times and CNN have published and produced different pieces highlighting the county and its unique way of life that still exists here in the mountains. Even the late chef, author, and documentarian, Anthony Bourdain spent time filming in McDowell and was quoted saying it was one of the most unique places he had traveled to.

You can see McDowell County's episode on season 11 of Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown.

Are you a railroad enthusiast? Bluefield prospered as a center for the railroad transport of coal.  Norfolk Southern still maintains an office at 800 Princeton Avenue in downtown Bluefield. The city offers many vantage points for photography, with spots where you can pull off the road and take spectacular photos as the trains rumble by. Of interest to children: The Ridgerunner train leaves on a milelong loop, from noon to 6 p.m. on weekends, from Bluefield City Park from April through September, but be careful: That train whistle is loud! For researchers and scholars, a wealth of information is tucked away in the Eastern Regional Coal Archives, which are attached to the Craft Memorial Library in Bluefield, including railroad memorabilia, maps, company records and historic photographs and documents.

Both Bluefield, West Virginia, and Bluefield, Virginia, have extensive bus service. The driveway is large enough to accommodate a trailer.
